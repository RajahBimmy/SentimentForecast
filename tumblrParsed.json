Thus, the seventh conference will revisit that amazing experience that attracted over 800 attendees ‚Äì an occasion that brought together artists and scholars from an assortment of disciplines and practices and offered comparative perspectives on the historical and contemporary role played by photography, art, film, literature, and music in referencing the image of the black body in the West. </p><p>Discussions will focus on aesthetics, style, history, and music in describing a sense of place and identity.

But what happens when you use design thinking to integrate technology with book distribution to underserved children? <br/></p><p>In 2007, Hediya Sizar (NYU Steinhardt ‚Äò2017) and her brother Sohale Sizar founded the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books Foundation</a>, a non-profit literacy organization that redistributes gently-used books to low-income neighborhoods in the New York City area. It began as a local book drive at a suburban high school, encouraging high schoolers to reroute their books to low-income schools in Philadelphia. ¬†Since its humble origins, the initiative has grown into an impactful nonprofit organization, collecting over 70,000 books at high school and college campuses across multiple states. With its adaptive nature, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">organization</a> has begun integrating technology to take the program to the next level. Now run through a cloud-based app platform, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books</a> directly connects donors to donation sites at their nearest location.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"851\" data-orig-height=\"314\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/a16499e75cc428282d72e240da847355/tumblr_inline_o2tfqvvGdh1t25dex_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"851\" data-orig-height=\"314\"/></figure><p>Hediya‚Äôs dedication to closing the access-to-books gap is deeply personal. At the age of nine, her parents relocated from her small town in Pennsylvania to South Korea. She recalls that, ¬†‚ÄúMy brother and I were the only international students in my new school. There were many language and cultural barriers, making it difficult to interact with my peers, so I found my sanctuary in books.‚Äù Hediya found Laura Ingalls Wilder‚Äôs Little House on the Prairie especially poignant because this 19th century pioneer family maintained positivity and strength throughout unimaginable hardship. Hediya notes, ‚Äútheir story encouraged me to appreciate my experience in South Korea. <b>The characters‚Äô resilience helped me work across differences and learn different perspectives, encouraging me to make friends with my peers in Korea.‚Äù</b><br/></p><p>Hediya knows first-hand that the stories found within the pages of books can build across differences. Scaling this vision into a nonprofit organization required taking stock of her own values and how to turn those into a tangible mission.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1502\" data-orig-height=\"911\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/9efafeab684b09f805853c5b07f02f6f/tumblr_inline_o2tfrnSJCo1t25dex_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1502\" data-orig-height=\"911\"/></figure><p>Hediya‚Äôs transformative experience as an NYU Leadership Fellow in (Class of 2014-2015) helped her on her journey to becoming a successful leader at Bring on the Books. The highlight of her fellowship was working on a group team challenge. Hediya reflects, ‚ÄúWe created a social media campaign and event called #ImNotPerfect, which celebrated our flaws as leaders and encouraged students to be open about vulnerabilities. During the creation of this project, I learned the importance of teamwork and I developed lasting relationships with my team. They are now some of my closest friends!‚Äù</p><p>As an NYU Leadership Fellow, Hediya worked one-one-one with a coach to create an individual development plan. Hediya expands that ‚ÄúThis helped me learn about myself as a leader and person in life. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Fellows Program, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to create measurable and effective goals to work on my strengths and areas of growth.‚Äù </p><p>She also cites meditation and mindfulness as practices that shape her leadership style. In fact, she participates weekly in <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/student-diversity/spiritual-life/mindfulness/student-groups-at-mindfulnyu.html\">Generation Meditation sessions at Global Spiritual Life</a>. She explains, ‚ÄúI incorporate mindfulness with leadership by engaging in empathetic listening, practicing more self-awareness, and learning how to stay focused in the present moment. This has helped create stronger clarity of my vision and be a better team player.‚Äù Hediya continues to hone her leadership skills around campus. She serves as a Program Assistant at the NYU Leadership Initiative, helping to grow and facilitate the same fellowship program that enhanced her own leadership skills.</p><p>And as ¬†a Media, Culture, and Communication major in Steinhardt, Hediya utilizes the many resources available to her at NYU to scale up Bring on the Books from the frequent donation model to a technology-driven crowdsourcing platform. In her own words she say says:</p><p>‚ÄúI wanted to build a love for literacy that would bring youth together. I wanted to share the beauty of stories. I wanted adolescents to know that they are not alone in this world, but rather there are characters who share the same emotions and experiences as them. I pursued my vision through a full time commitment to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books</a>.‚Äù<br/></p><p>If you have any books lying around, reroute them ¬†at the ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/?ref=bookmarks\">Bring on the Books</a>‚Äù Drive happening now during Violet 100 Week (Feb. 22nd-26th).

It was\na great job that I learned to pick up things really quick and respond to market\nand client‚Äôs request timely and accurately, and I got the chance to work with\npeople from different trading rooms in different branches around the world. Jut\nthat I still fell like some things is missing: every deal is coming and done so\nfast that I don&rsquo;t even have time to think about it, to plan it and put my\nthought in it, everything is according to foreign exchange market. At the mean\ntime, I looked at some of my friends who work in marketing role in\nmarketing-driven companies such as L‚ÄôOreal or Pepsi Co, their life is pretty\ndifferent; they plan for marketing campaigns, promotions, and events. They are\ntrained to have fresh eye on the market trend, and use different tools and\napproaches to catch customer needs and cerate opportunities. This sounds more\nlike a job I can do and enjoy for a long time, so I decided to leave JPMorgan\nand applied for master in marketing program in states, trying to change my\ncareer path.</p><p>After one semester here, though those basic\nmarketing classes, internship experience and some events such as advertising\nweek and marketing mix in NYU Stern, I‚Äôve learned so much about digital\nmarketing. Digital marketing world is like a comprehensive ecosystem and it\nkeeps changing every day. From my previous intern at an e-commerce start-up, I\nlearned to observe customer behavior through Google Trend, Google Analytics and\nGoogle AdWords; and use those information to create marketing campaign for\nsocial media platforms, website, emails, and influencers outreach. Fortunately\nall these effort turned out to be actual sales and increased likes in social\nmedia platforms, I feel like that we have built a good connection with\ncustomers. From all these precious experiences I found myself enjoy doing\ndigital marketing strategies, so I‚Äôm excited to take the digital marketing\nclass this semester to learn more of it, and apply to my internship and job in\nthe future.

None of us knew how to cook; we‚Äôve not taken classes or trained as chefs, but insofar as cooking for our friends in a place so far from anywhere any of us have ever known, it seemed appropriate to think back to the food in our own homes.¬†<i>‚ÄúI remember the _____ mom would make for us‚Ä¶‚Äù </i>And in thinking about the edible magic our moms used to bring our families together, I guess we tried to emulate some of that magic too.</p><p>So I present to you,¬†‚ÄúThis Is How My Mama Made It‚Äù:</p><figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/b5e3257efd925b2b388e08e42b865110/tumblr_inline_o2ofg0PWWI1qffdbv_540.jpg\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/23dd4e9118e76977b42f2b5f2291e104/tumblr_inline_o2psagYD7N1qffdbv_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"360\" data-orig-src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/b5e3257efd925b2b388e08e42b865110/tumblr_inline_o2ofg0PWWI1qffdbv_540.jpg\"/></figure><blockquote><p><i>First night cooking.

She was prepared: she had a vision for the company, a business plan, and a business partner in her husband Rob King.</p><p>But there was just one thing holding her back: student loan debt. And a lot of it.</p><p>True graduated with her MFA in acting from New York University in 1998, and worked for more than a decade as a performer in New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen they interviewed me for admission to NYU as part of the admission process, they asked me ‚ÄòHow do you plan on paying for it?‚Äô‚Äù she recalls.</p><!-- more -->\n\n<blockquote><ul><li><b>Who:</b> Noel True</li>\n<li><b>Lives in:</b> Los Angeles, Calif.</li>\n<li><b>Profession:</b> Founder, Little Pictures production company</li>\n<li><b>Her degree:</b> MFA, 1998, New York University</li>\n<li><b>Annual cost of attendance (two semesters), 2015:</b> $88,000</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>‚ÄúI was 21 years old and I thought, ‚ÄòWell, I don‚Äôt know how right now, but I know this is what I‚Äôm going to be doing for the rest of my life. I know I‚Äôm passionate about it, and I know I‚Äôll find a way.‚Äô‚Äù</p>\n\n<p>That ‚Äúway‚Äù included taking more than $100,000 in student loans for graduate school.</p><p>But the unpredictable schedule of being a working actor on shows like <i>Veronica Mars</i>, <i>Bones</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> meant that her income ‚Äî and paying off her loans ‚Äî was erratic. True had to use loan forbearance several times and that meant she fell behind on paying them off for good.</p>\n\n\n\n                    \n                    <figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/earnest-static-assets/blog/student+loan+refinancing+NYU+MFA+2.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\"/></figure><h3>Moving behind the camera</h3><p>Then, in 2010, True decided to move behind the scenes and began freelancing in the video production business. She officially formed her own company, <a href=\"http://littlepictures.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Pictures</a>, in 2012.</p><p>While her professional life was moving forward, her loan burden remained and affected her personal financial progress. In fact, when she and her husband decided to buy a house, they omitted her name from the loan so she would not appear as a liability.</p><p>At that point, she says, her students loans payments were so large and the principal had been capitalized so many times, ‚ÄúI was beginning to wonder if I was going to be paying for my children‚Äôs grad school before I even paid off my own grad school.‚Äù</p><blockquote><p><i>Noel‚Äôs money tips:</i></p><p><b>1. Research newer <a href=\"http://blog.meetearnest.com/post/133822756882/compare-student-loan-refinancing-companies\" target=\"_blank\">refinancing options</a> even if you have been out of school for many years.</b>‚ÄúFor so many years policies changed but they never included people like me who‚Äôd been out of school for so long or whose debt was so great or who had exhausted their forbearance efforts.‚Äù</p><p><br/><b>2. Get your personal finances in order to improve your professional finances.</b>&ldquo;When starting your own business, your financial house has to be in order, your intentions have to be in order, and your confidence and your abilities have to be in order.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3>A new peace of mind</h3><p>Even though she had been out of school for more than 15 years, she began researching options to help get her student loan debt into a better place especially now that she was running a successful production company.</p><p>Earnest, she says, appealed to her for its <a href=\"http://blog.meetearnest.com/post/131230998947/how-does-earnest-compare-to-traditional-lenders\" target=\"_blank\">non-traditional way</a> of considering borrowers.</p><p>That included people like herself: self-employed and had the means to pay back a loan but didn‚Äôt necessarily look that great in a traditional model on paper. ‚ÄúI needed to refinance so I could take back my life and not have this thing from 18 years ago hanging over my head as I started a new venture in my life,‚Äù she says. </p><p>True&rsquo;s story bucks the current narrative that student loans are holding back entrepreneurship. While startup activity by younger Americans is <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/12/new-hope-for-young-entrepreneurs-strangled-by-student-debt.html\" target=\"_blank\">below historical trends</a>, True&rsquo;s experience reveals how entrepreneurs saddled with student loan debt are finding innovative ways to deal with it.</p><p>By refinancing, she shaved $400 off her monthly payments and reduced her term from 12 to four years.</p><p>Today, getting her student loan debt into a better place has helped her to be able to fully focus on the growth of her company, and better satisfy employees and customers.</p><p>‚ÄúStudent loans used to be something that I thought about constantly.

Didn&rsquo;t even thought about doing usually. The same went for this night. Aira&rsquo;s eyes stared upwards to the skies, looked at the unclouded nightsky, that seemed to be so easily reachable. She listened to some voices. Calm and definitly not angry at her, most not even nooticing her at all.</p>\n\n<p>Only one voice&hellip;definitly was aware of her.</p>\n\n<p>¬§ So? Do you think, this will work out, Aira? ¬§</p>\n\n<p>The stargazer simply smiled and closed her eyes, sighing out loudly. &ldquo;I mean &hellip; things changed &hellip;&rdquo;, she whispered as an answer, a rusty laugh returning. She knew just well enough he wasn&rsquo;t up there, knew he couldn&rsquo;t be up there. Never. Not in a million years again. &ldquo;She is &hellip; I &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Stopping, she sighed out loud and shook her head. &ldquo;She is &hellip; as important to me as Relius was, father &hellip;&rdquo;, she said and closed her eyes smiling.

The following silence was incredible deep and long, swallowing all sounds, that they could make, as she slowed her breathing, preparing for the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You wonder who I was talking to&hellip;right?&rdquo;, she simply said without turning towards the person that was behind her somewhere. The leaves of the tree she was sitting in rustled from the wind, her hair hiding her face for a moment, as she closed her eyes. &ldquo;You wonder if I am talking to myself.

Implemented within supportive New York City community schools, the program helps support children with ASD ‚Äúlearn how to function well academically, behaviorally, and socially in school and in their community,‚Äù without isolating them from their peers and the rest of their school environment. For more detail about the NEST program and model, see this <a href=\"http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/asdnest/about/doe\">brochure</a> and this <a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/95239747\">video</a>.</p><p>Since I didn‚Äôt know anything about the NEST program prior to my visit, I was excited to absorb as much information as possible. Since this visit was organized through the fabulous <a href=\"http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/InterschoolCollaboration/showcase\">Showcase Schools</a> program, not only did the group of educators gathered at the school hear from its principal and teachers, but we also visited multiple classrooms in order to see elements of the program in action.¬†</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/817d132801d7cb7cdc114d2d4cfb95a9/tumblr_inline_o2ew96sITQ1qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>Some of the most striking examples of smart thinking and strategies for ASD-focused inclusion were the simplest ‚Äî and also often ones that had clear benefit for all students in the class. For instance, the school had developed basic <i>movement </i>and¬†<i>volume </i>scales to help kids rank their movement and voice level in the classroom and hallways.¬†</p><p>Another ingenious and simple example was the problem scale, which helps kids determine whether the issue they‚Äôre experiencing is more of a 1 at a¬†‚Äúglitch‚Äù level, or a 5 at the other end of the spectrum, which is an emergency requiring intense adult help. Tools like these scales provide a method and vocabulary for kids to use in both identifying and explaining the problem they face, as well as learning what qualifies as an appropriate response.¬†</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/70d3d543512105da5ea8db6f928f8cff/tumblr_inline_o2ewa7zyso1qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>Lastly, every classroom I visited had constructed a¬†‚Äúbreak area,‚Äù where students could take a self-elected pause from whatever was happening in class to calm down or find a moment of quiet. The break areas were outfitted with comfortable seating such as a bean bag, and various things to read or play with; one even had candles on a shelf that kids could smell. The idea was to provide a safe space to self-soothe and regain composure away from peers ‚Äî something I think most adults in the workforce would beg for if they had the opportunity! Tools like this break area not only echo some of the workplace psychology influencing the office environments of tech companies like Google and Facebook, but also encourage self-care and health of the¬†‚Äòwhole child,‚Äô not just the academic student.¬†</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/89e93932fc7762602c2799c41323e70d/tumblr_inline_o2ewauo3D51qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>While I was impressed by the teachers I saw in the classrooms, I was mostly surprised and heartened by the children. The students in these classrooms exemplified a range of learners ‚Äî some held onto ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.therapyshoppe.com/category/1052-fidget-toys-classroom-fidgets-focus-concentration-toys-tools\">fidgets</a>‚Äù to help keep their hands occupied while they listed, some wore noise-canceling headphones while reading, some used the support of bouncy ball chairs or¬†‚Äòpitch scales‚Äô to monitor their own voices. All of them, however, were happy and eager to explain their tools; none were embarrassed or susceptible to the idea that these tools meant they were at all¬†‚Äòless than‚Äô or had¬†‚Äòspecial needs.‚Äô It was a helpful reminder that sending the message that <i>everyone</i> has needs, and that we should embrace the tools that help us each meet them, is an extremely important thing for teachers and schools to do in cultivating a healthy, supportive and inclusive community. Go, NEST ASD program!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139141727456,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_yq4t21bVaJW","DateString":"2016-02-12","Text":"<p>DRUM TAO Presents DRUM HEART #nyu #skirball  (at Skirball Center for the Performing Arts)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139141137743,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z2jDEt21bTKLF","DateString":"2016-02-12","Text":"<p>Havent seen a show in such a long time!

And what is even more wonderful is that there was a window seat in Argo Tea. As I drink some hibiscus apple cider - because today is very fucking cold - I&rsquo;m just looking out at the street. Greene and Washington Place. It&rsquo;s one of those little moments when I sort of breathe in the everydayness that still surprises me. It still surprises me that I&rsquo;m here. Today me and some friends from high school were talking and laughing about old times. When I think back to those times, it kind of astounds me I&rsquo;m here now; so far away, and in the place I had always wanted to go. A place I&rsquo;d never even seen until after I left school. I am so beyond happy that I&rsquo;m here. Even though it&rsquo;s crazy, busy, stressful, tiring and sometimes not easy. But I like that it&rsquo;s not a simple place where nothing happens. I like walking with people who know how to walk. I like doing homework in the library and seeing the financial district grow dark outside. I like glancing out of my bedside window to see what colour the Empire State Building is each night before I go to sleep - if it&rsquo;s before 2am, that is. I like drinking overpriced coffee and pretending to be American when I order it. Mostly I love seeing my friends and acquaintances every day and talking to them about anything. They&rsquo;re all such beautiful, fun, smart people and after even a two minute conversation I feel a burst of happiness that I am lucky to have met all of these wonderful people. From all walks of life and backgrounds with a vast array of paths and goals. I love the people who live in this city. And when it&rsquo;s all getting too much and overwhelming, I remind myself of the girl I used to be, who spent her every waking and sleeping moment desperate to be here, doing what I am doing. I wouldn&rsquo;t change my time at the Atlantic for anything. It has been precious and invaluable and beautiful. Even if they do send us off campus too much. I do love it. And even though my goals and dreams today are not the same as the goals and dreams I had when I was sixteen, they&rsquo;re still completely bound up with this city and all the experiences I have undergone here. I&rsquo;m promising myself that I&rsquo;ll never take anything about this place for granted. None of it. Well. I finished my tea and now my free time is done. I&rsquo;ve got to run to my Zionism and Israel class, one of the most fascinating things I&rsquo;ve ever learned about and something else on the endless list of things I&rsquo;m thankful to have in my life. So happy. So stressed. So blessed. Total mess. That&rsquo;s my life and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139122099347,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z0xUWt21aKiIJ","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p>Day like today makes me long for Spring like this shot of #washingtonsquare park with the early tress blooming! #NewYorkfromAbove #newbook #aerialphotography #helicopter #newyork #architecturalphotography #architecture #landmark #greenwichvillage #nyu  (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139121124736,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zdflmv21aG_M0","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p>avian species are occasionally cooperative #washingtonsquarepark #nyuvibe #nyu  (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139114590616,"NoteCount":25,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv21Zu36O","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/2fb4a57df24d736ef7b7ae54cd0fa5ea/tumblr_inline_o232cxKJzk1ro0zrp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure></p><p>Valentine‚Äôs Day is coming up, and you‚Äôve had your eyes set on your cute floormate for the past couple of days now.

I didn‚Äôt focus on the price tag because I doubted I would get admitted.</p><p>¬†Once admitted I was thrilled for a good five minutes before I checked my NYU account and realized how much financial aid I would receive. I‚Äôd heard of people getting full rides and how the Shanghai campus apparently had better FA than the NY campus.

In fact, by comparison to some of my good friends I&rsquo;ve met through the years, I&rsquo;m a relative newcomer to the scene. But damn did it get a grip on me.

Want to come and do this job for me with a bunch of famous people?‚Äù She name drops a few people, gives me her number, and tells me to call her tomorrow.¬†</p><p>So, I‚Äôm sitting here like,¬†‚ÄúWTF just happened?‚Äù and my sister, my mom and I are having this three way chat where my mom‚Äôs like¬†‚Äúthis is sketchy, what if she‚Äôs a serial kidnapper‚Äù and my sister‚Äôs like,¬†‚ÄúOH MY GOD SHE TEXTED OUR PICTURE TO [INSERT FAMOUS PERSON HERE]‚Äù and I‚Äôm like,¬†‚Äúoh wow this is going to be awesome.‚Äù¬†</p><p>So, on Sunday I talk to her on the phone and she basically tells me that this could shoot my career up and I‚Äôm like¬†‚Äúomg this is sick‚Äù and she‚Äôs telling me all about the doors and opportunities that will open up for me in the next four years and then she tells me the date of the shoot (which is in a few weeks) and then we say goodbye. Little did I know, I would spend the rest of the week being harassed by my parents about the possibility of a kidnapping. I‚Äôll admit, the situation was different, and being cautious is probably better than not being cautious, but I like to think there‚Äôs some good left in humanity and that this woman is going to get my film career started.</p><p>Sunday was pretty normal: I officially joined <a href=\"http://wsnunderthearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Under the Arch</a>¬†(which is basically the bloggy and creative version of <a href=\"http://www.nyunews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Square News</a>) and attended my first meeting as one of Assistant Managers for Cabaret. Both were very enjoyable, and I cannot wait to see how Cabaret is going to be in April! So that was the weekend.</p><p>Now on to the week: Monday was pretty mundane (for my normal week, not in general). I went to class and then rehearsal (where I got to watch the cast sing and dance so that was cool). Tuesday was a little more fun. I went to <a href=\"http://xianfoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Xi‚Äôan Famous Foods</a>¬†for dinner and ate some<a href=\"http://xianfoods.com/menu/\" target=\"_blank\"> Spicy Hot Oil Seared Hand-Ripped Noodles</a>.¬†</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/0f323a2d5f690e3d37247aeadd2cbff0/tumblr_inline_o23ijrm7hk1t887t9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>Afterwards, went to a (supposedly) popular ice cream place called <a href=\"http://www.vanleeuwenicecream.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Van Leeuwan</a></p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/78d5899d5179c666ebbf91f1b42e5d9a/tumblr_inline_o23isnuA4o1t887t9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"/></figure><p><br/></p><p>It had a cute atmosphere, that reminded me of small town combined with a hipster-y touch.</p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"><img src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/2def49df1cf6652e90d35c0171b449d0/tumblr_inline_o23itrwcAL1t887t9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"/></figure><p><i>I mean you can‚Äôt look at those jars and tell me they‚Äôre not hipster<br/></i></p><p><br/></p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/04daac40f663a36f42a0f298195e139e/tumblr_inline_o23iu3JzfN1t887t9_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"750\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"/></figure><p><i>Saloon anyone?</i></p><p><br/></p><p>I got some cookies and cream ice cream (the one pictured is my friend‚Äôs Earl Grey with Fluffernutter), and overall the ice cream wasn‚Äôt too bad.

We were greeted by a seemingly chill TA, and she basically showered us in chocolate (which I happen to love so she‚Äôs already won me over) and I made some friends&ndash; in fact, I had lunch with one of the girls I met in recitation today.

So I think\nthat‚Äôs also been difficult‚Äîtrying to become a part of the NYUCN community.

And also, understand the efforts and intentionality the 2019 Class Activities Board has put into making this NYU tradition a reality.</p><p><b>While there may be elements of the Oscars in our Hollywood-themed SnoBall aesthetics and decorations, we want you to know that we acknowledge the Oscars can be problematic.</b> Recently, there‚Äôs been a social movement that has gained visibility on Social Media and in the news ‚Äì <b>#OscarsSoWhite</b>. Why? This movement calls attention to the absence of color and diversity seen in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences‚Äô 2016 Oscar nominees. <b>For the second year in a row, ALL 20 actors/actresses nominated in the lead and supporting acting categories are white.</b> In the Academy Awards‚Äô 88-year history, only 14 black actors have won acting Oscars. Furthermore, representation of people of color of other identities is even lower. In the history of the Oscars, only 5 Latino actors have won (most recently, Benicio Del Toro in 2001) and only 3 Asian actors have been recognized with a win (the last was Haing S. Ngor in 1985). These facts were found in this <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/02/oscars-academy-award-nominations-diversity/79645542/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, please let us know if you have other info for us to amend our facts.</p><p>In response, many actors made a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/movies/spike-lee-jada-pinkett-smith-oscars.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to boycott the Oscars</a> in solidarity if no changes were made. In spreading their message, the movement has gained widespread support. Amidst the movement, the 51-member committee decided the implementation of new rules. Some of these include a commitment to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-et-mn-oscars-reform-20160123-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">doubling the number of women and minorities in the academy by 2020</a> and limiting lifetime voting rights.</p><p><b>With the 2019 Class Activities Board‚Äôs (CAB19) SnoBall Dance coming up, we are excited to celebrate the diversity that NYU and New York City has offered us this past semester.</b> Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://orgsync.com/119075/forms/182815\" target=\"_blank\">our own nomination process</a> that we created to celebrate our NYU 2019 community.

The spotlight cuts in and out, every three seconds or so, finally revealing that she is using only the arch at the back of her neck to remain suspended, hundreds of feet in the air.<br/></p><p>Music usually accompanies acts like these. But Ocktobre pointedly leaves the background noise out of this performance, and the effect is electrifying: each gasp from the audience is amplified. The only light in the theatre is a single shaking spotlight on the performer‚Äôs near-naked body, above an unlit chandelier. Circus isn‚Äôt usually like that‚Äîin fact, it‚Äôs an art form known for its flashing lights and intricate costumes. </p><p>But the aim of Circus Now is to test everything we think we know about circus. It‚Äôs an ancient art form that began in Europe and was later brought to America, where it evolved into what we see today‚Äîthink elephants and sequins. Circus Now is different. They let the talent of their artists do the talking, not their elephants or set displays. The show wasn‚Äôt a display of ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù circus at all, but instead a return to what the circus genre was built upon: the talent of the artist. ¬†</p><p>The Acrobatic Conundrum, which performed Thursday night, included a solo act by a Cyr wheel artist, who began by imploring us, the audience, to look at him instead of the other acrobats on stage. This spiraled into a monologue about perfectionism and the struggle for attention in a high-tension performing art. Then he lunged into a meticulously timed display of superhuman strength and skill, while standing inside the Cyr wheel and grasping it‚Äôs rim, causing it to spin gyroscopically and performing acrobatic moves inside the rotating wheel. </p><p>We sat startlingly close to members of the Bindlestiff Family Circus, and other (remarkably well-dressed‚Äîthink, sideshow-vintage-chic) fans of circus. </p><p>The Emcee, Sxip Shirey, shared stories about his international circus travels, and an audience member corrected his details, ‚ÄúNo, that act used five rigs, not three!‚Äù Someone else shouted ‚ÄúHallo!‚Äù when Sxip mentioned a German troupe he toured with fifteen years ago. We begin to get the feeling that everyone in the theatre is somehow connected. And that I, a mere outsider to the mysterious and illustrious world of circus, was bid a very welcome entry to their world, led me to realize why people run away to the circus: </p><p>Acceptance. It‚Äôs an embrace, no, a glorification‚Äîof every uncategorized or perceivably ‚Äústrange‚Äù talent that wouldn‚Äôt have a context anywhere else. And people cheer encore for it. </p><p>Outside I sipped coffee during intermission, and ran into a small band of jugglers, the next act, who were waiting to walk on stage. They said hello in unison as I walked by, as if they weren‚Äôt holding bowling pins in each hands and wearing uniforms. ‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúMy name is Nicole.‚Äù They fumbled to trade bowling pins so we could shake hands, one by one. And after I left the music kicked in, and they went on stage. </p><p>Circus looks different from the inside: it‚Äôs a warm, welcoming environment where you can forget about reality for a while as the very laws of gravity are defied and your heart soars. In Circus Now the roots of circus are exposed, and the art form has never been more bracing. Moreover, I now have a bunch of friends who travel the world in caravans. </p><hr><p>Information on Circus Now 2016 can be found on <a href=\"http://nyuskirball.org/calendar/cn2016\" target=\"_blank\">NYU Skirball‚Äôs website</a>.¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138616380908,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZyfQYl216BXti","DateString":"2016-02-03","Text":"<p><em>read this in a british accent</em></p>\n\n<p>classes have started, and my semester at n.y.u. in london has begun. more than anything, this post is meant as a way for me to map out my next few writings. i&rsquo;ve kept a running list of ideas since the previous semester, and i think it&rsquo;s quite time i start removing some items. i had originally planned using this post to discuss my usage of various messaging platforms, however it appears that there is too much to say in too little time. it shall be the post following this one.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138612254733,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlwUGq215xoWD","DateString":"2016-02-03","Text":"<p>Throwback when Marty @martinscorsese_ speaking to us and for us at graduation.

We often see good design in our everyday life and we just don‚Äôt notice it. It could be your own business card or the stop sign on the street. All these things are designed in a way to grab your attention while still being visually appealing to the eye.</p><p>I think the most important concept I learned was proximity. I didn‚Äôt really notice before how having an object next to another can affect the designs outcome so much. Being well aligned and proximate allows for good organization in your design. Another key topic was white space, which I thought was very useful. You want to leave enough whitespace to focus the design on a few aspects but not so much that it looks barren and boring. All these points are crucial for good design that doesn‚Äôt make your eyes hurt and can be easy to read to get your message across effectively.</p><p>Something that confused me I would say was repetition. We are expected to make a design look random, but at the same time intentional. How can one do that effectively? Can we be randomly intentional? We must keep the consistency the same but in a random and intentional order.¬†</p><p>I think the photo below is a good representation of alignment and proximity because of its ample white space. This helps maintain the center of attention for ¬†its audience while being simple enough to convey a clear message. The logo and tag line at the bottom also help the viewer know who mad it just in case they are unfamiliar with the company without overpowering the message. I think this is also a good example of repetition because you see the logo twice on the ad.

Maybe it was the whole ‚Äúsummer camp‚Äù-type setup but it brought out a side of me I‚Äôd almost forgotten. It‚Äôd been a long time since I‚Äôd seen my 8 year-old self, worn her shoes and laughed the way she laughed. And in doing so a lot of little fragments of that time surfaced and bobbed in my conscious. Like, memories from Girl Scouts camping trips - especially how to make a good s‚Äômore. Like, the Kookaburra song (apt because I am in Australia) that we learned for Small World Day in third grade. It was so hot on the island; Australian sun is really much harsher than East Coast US sun (sunscreen is a MUST!) but even when I was sweating like a pig, I still ran around playing cricket, hiking, swimming, kayaking. I didn‚Äôt care that I was tired and gross and tanned. The world was infinite fun and challenge, the way recess had been so long ago. It was like all the restrictions I‚Äôve internalized of every passing year since fell away and all that was left was an openness to relish every moment. In time, the ridiculous shorts-tan I‚Äôve achieved will fade or blend, but for now it‚Äôll remind me to take a step back and see the world as an 8 year-old.¬†</p><p>On Sunday, we explored a little more of Sydney on our own. I‚Äôll write about that in another post but for now, first day of classes today. Wish me luck!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138435342905,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZnxdMt20xOx8v","DateString":"2016-01-31","Text":"<!-- more -->\n<a href=\"http://amyinthemaking.tumblr.com/post/137766038124/tips-for-a-semester-abroad\" target=\"_blank\">amyinthemaking</a>:\n<blockquote><h2>Tips for a Semester Abroad</h2>\n<p>As I prepare for another thrilling semester in Florence, Italy, I began thinking of all the items that I‚Äôm taking in my suitcase.

I‚Äôm in love. The city is beautiful. Everyday I wake up and feel like I‚Äôm in a Medieval movie! The architecture, which my Instagram followers are probably well aware of by now, is almost all gothic/romantic. I‚Äôm sure there is a better term for the style, but unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt taken an architecture tour yet. Soon, I promise!</p><p>The food here is one of my favorite things I‚Äôve experienced so far. Beer culture is alive and well in this city. First and foremost, Czechs are proud of their Pilsner Urquell. You‚Äôve probably heard of Pilsner beer&ndash;well Pilsner Urquell was the first type of beer of this kind (from Plzen, a city in CZ). It‚Äôs far above the traditional PBR and Budweiser you can get in America, and usually a large glass is a little over a dollar. Beer might not be cheaper than water here, but it‚Äôs damn close.¬†</p><p>I‚Äôve found that the Czech people are generally much quieter and more polite than the kind of people you‚Äôd find in America. The tram that I take everyday to get to the city center and my classes is quiet aside from a few whispered conversations. Usually it is us NYU students who make up the majority of the sound every morning. Furthermore, I‚Äôve noticed that, while homelessness is a lot less obvious here as it is in New York, the poor people I‚Äôve seen here are generally quieter and more respectful of your personal boundaries. I have yet to see a visibly homeless person on the trams, and the few that I have seen usually are silently bowing on the streets with their hands stretched in supplication. It‚Äôs odd to me as an American to see such resigned, dignified posture among the homeless.¬†</p><p>Also, they don‚Äôt give plastic bags out for free in the stores here in Prague! It‚Äôs strange but also makes me so pleased! I always thought America was the center of environmental friendliness. Especially in my home town of San Jose, CA, I figured that the US led the way in terms of green technology (i.e. hybrid cars). However, it was only just recently that my city placed a plastic bag tax on stores. We haven‚Äôt even outright banned plastic bags&ndash;it‚Äôs still the default to have your items bagged this way. But in many stores I‚Äôve been to in Prague, the cash register will not bag your items unless you specifically ask for a bag (which I think is called <i>tasku </i>in Czech).¬†</p><p>I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have more observations later, but these are the biggest things I‚Äôve noticed so far.¬†</p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Anyway, on to the scary accident of the night: some friends and I were returning on the late night tram after a nice round of drinks at the Hemingway Bar (a touristy 20s themed bar with amazing cocktails). We just got on the tram we needed to take back to Osadni and were about a minute into the last leg of our tram ride home.¬†</p><p>Now to preface the story: In Prague, trams here are aboveground and typically have the right of way because their mass makes it hard to slow down fast. So as a pedestrian, you have the right of way when it comes to crossing the street in front of a car, but you don‚Äôt have the right of way when it comes to trams. Same with other vehicles: cars must stop for trams.¬†</p><p>Anyway, I was standing facing the front of the tram, looking over the back of my friend who had grabbed a seat in front of me. Honestly, I was slightly tipsy, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw a car come from the street that merged through the tram tracks.¬†</p><p>It was as if everything had slowed down. In the back of my mind, I thought to myself,¬†‚ÄúThat can‚Äôt be safe‚Äù when all of the sudden the tram and car collided! Luckily I was holding firmly onto a pole so I wasn‚Äôt thrown out of my seat or anything. I can say right now I escaped with no injuries, nor did my friends!¬†</p><p>The tram driver emerged from his little driving compartment and muttered,¬†‚ÄúDebil‚Äù under his breath. Don‚Äôt ask me why, but I know this word means¬†‚Äúasshole‚Äù in Czech. They didn‚Äôt teach me this in Czech class, just FYI.¬†</p><p>A minute later, he got back on the tram. I was afraid he would rattle off a list of instructions in Czech to us and i wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand anything he said. Thankfully, the rest of the people on the tram seemed to start filing off, so my friends and I took this as our cue to get off and leave. We weren‚Äôt too far from Osandi by then, so we decided just to take the walk back on foot.¬†</p><p>It was a strange way to end the night, and I‚Äôm grateful it looked like everyone on the tram and even the car‚Äôs driver were unharmed. It also makes me wonder about the traffic laws in Prague. I haven‚Äôt seen much¬†‚Äúunsafe‚Äù driving, but I do remember my first reaction to hearing the right of way laws regarding trams my first day here was skepticism. There are very few stop signs and lights at intersections and merges here (at least compared to the US). While that means less traffic backup and a smoother ride overall, I can only guess what that means in terms of safe driving.¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138368583122,"NoteCount":55,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20tQGNI","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138361530906,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQlkHi20s-MeQ","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":"<p>It‚Äôs expensive but my dad wants me close to home.<br/><br/>I‚Äôve been looking at studyblrs for a while and I can‚Äôt wait to buy my school supplies in August!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138352071799,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn20sRHHt","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244249092&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/rachel-ag-gilman\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel A.G.

I go to New York University, but I feel like a lot of other collegiate libraries have similar features and therefore this might be of use to non NYU folk!</p><p>Basically, NYU‚Äôs Bobst library is seriously vast and connected. It is most likely that the book you are looking for has a place on the shelves. Start with a search on <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">BobCat</a>¬†and select the filters¬†‚Äúat Bobst‚Äù and¬†‚Äúavailable‚Äù to see if that book is on the shelf right now for you to go and get. This was the case for about 20% of my textbooks. If you can‚Äôt find the book on the shelf and it says it‚Äôs available, a librarian can <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/forms/services/quick_search_request.html\" target=\"_blank\">do the search for you</a> (at a time when you aren‚Äôt counting down 15 min between classes)</p><p>The next line of defense is <a href=\"https://pds.library.nyu.edu/ezborrow\" target=\"_blank\">EZ-Borrow</a>, which is an expedited book-exchange system. EZ-Borrow keeps track of the availabilities in library catalogs in the tri-state area. I just ordered like 5 books to be at Bobst from Penn State and Rutgers. The book will arrive at Bobst in 3-5 days, so I stocked up on everything for the rest of the semester so I wouldn‚Äôt be caught without a text at the last minute.¬†</p><p>Finally, there <a href=\"http://ill.library.nyu.edu/illiad/illiad.dll\" target=\"_blank\">ILL</a> (inter-library loan), aka We Will Get This Damn Book For U. ILL goes beyond just NYU/affiliated college libraries and sources from places like the NYPL. This is also how you get non-book materials to Bobst. ILL is also great for requesting *sections* of a book, so if you only need specific chapters, a librarian somewhere in the world will find them, beautifully scan them, and send them to Bobst. That way you don‚Äôt have to worry about a giant book <i>or</i>¬†a due date. Yeah! (These materials also arrive in 3 to 5 days)</p><p>Both EZ-Borrow and ILL let you keep the book as long as if you‚Äôd checked it out from Bobst (12 weeks).¬†</p><p>If all else fails, Bobst has an option where you can literally <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/forms/collections/recommend.html\" target=\"_blank\">put in a request</a> for a book you think they should have on their shelves. Of course that can‚Äôt guarantee they‚Äôll buy it by the time you need to finish that research paper, but surely future generations will thank you.¬†</p><p>I know a lot of this might seem obvious, but I have spent hundreds of dollars on textbooks for the past 7 semesters of college just because of the convenience and the thought that there‚Äôs really no better way. But after sitting down today and requesting all of my books from the library, I found just clicking¬†‚Äúrequest‚Äù 50 times was easier than spending hundreds of dollars and eating halal food for dinner that night (lol).¬†</p><p>Libraries are basically the shit and I definitely wish I‚Äôd taken advantage of these resources before it was my last semester of college!!</p><p>I hope this helps at least one person! &lt;3</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138175960279,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20hxTJN","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138175695001,"NoteCount":47,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z7S40v20hwSYP","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":"<p>Instagram: justgirlywishes</p><p>Twitter: wishespage</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138169304996,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zn8DBi20hY4Ua","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":"<p>The last 24 hours have been insane.</p><p><i><b>About 24 hours ago - 26 Jan 2016 11 PM</b></i></p><p>Ryosuke, Lina, Amanda, and I arrived at Urbanest Student Accommodation after sharing a cab from the airport (which cost about 20 AUS dollars each).

I landed in Frankfurt after an 11 hour flight that went pretty smoothly. There was little turbulence, and I spent the time reading <i>Ten</i>¬†<i>Thousand Skies Above </i>by Claudia Gray and watching a few movies (<i>Julie and Julia, The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, </i>and <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>). Unfortunately, due to jetlag, I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to sleep longer than a couple hours (something that would really bite me in the ass later).¬†</p><p>After I landed in Frankfurt, I was solely focused on getting to my gate. The walk from the terminal our plane landed in to the next gate took forever! I was so surprised how large the airport was. The other thing that surprised me was the ease at which I passed through customs. There was a small border gate with a nonexistent line. The guard (who looked like a young Michael Fassbender *swoon*) barely looked at my passport, asked me pleasantly if I was going to Prague to study, and sent me on my way. It took all of 5 minutes. After that, I had to pass through another security checkpoint. This took a little longer, mostly due to my poor planning. 1) I hadn‚Äôt emptied my water bottle that I‚Äôd filled in San Francisco, so I had to chug the whole thing before passing through this next gate. 2) I didn‚Äôt take out my Kindle when I sent my backpack through the scanner. In the U.S., I never had any problems leaving my e-Readers in my backpack, so I was surprised when the guard got angry at me for leaving mine in my backpack.¬†</p><p>After all the hassle at the security checkpoint, I found my gate about an hour and a half before boarding. I could already tell who was an NYU student and who wasn‚Äôt (mainly by who was young and speaking American English). Our plane got delayed for boarding by another 45 minutes due to inclement weather in Prague.¬†</p><p>The flight to Prague was short &ndash; only 40 minutes in the air. It still hadn‚Äôt hit me yet that I was going to be living in a foreign country for the next 4 months! I was more concerned about finding my luggage and getting to the dorm in one piece. Luckily, after I landed, I was able to get both of my suitcases without any problems (#blessed) and found the NYU Prague staff waiting for us at the airport. There were a lot of us on the Frankfurt flight, and it was clear that we were all exhausted from our journeys. While waiting for the Prague shuttle, we all were gathered in a sort of miniature herd based on our dorms. It was mostly silent although there was some small talk that essentially served to keep us alert.¬†</p><p>I almost fell asleep on the shuttle ride to my dorm, Osadni. The one thing I noticed was that the radio station playing in the shuttle played mostly American pop songs. I wonder if that‚Äôs because of Western media dominance in Central Europe or if the driver wanted to please our American music palettes. ¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137950606666,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6U2Ow20UVpLA","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<p>So awesome</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137947100127,"NoteCount":395,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zg8yww20UIRFV","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/a7e6dbcb2302cdbc2f02489cd99c55b0/tumblr_inline_o1gk06jZj41r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/18410a8c3635429c927cfb1ef7986e9e/tumblr_inline_o1gk0eTqJk1r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><p>&hellip;uh&hellip;thanks&hellip;?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137947054852,"NoteCount":100,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zg8yww20UIGC4","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/252442ea650ee75a1dd9bed48d72aa84/tumblr_inline_o1glso418X1r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><p>It‚Äôs always great to meet people back from the DA days again through this wonderful fandom!

Then HKG to SYD. Then, the same coming back with a 1 hour layover at the end of the semester. I‚Äôd put off buying my tickets until only a month before my departure so I was looking for the best price that I could find.

According to one <a href=\"http://www.hercampus.com/life/travel/study-abroad-packing-musts-what-wear-study-abroad-different-countries\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, I should pack like I‚Äôm heading to California. (Both places enjoy warm weather and an active lifestyle.) However, by the time I leave the only continent-nation in the world, it will be fall. Temperature highs in Australia in January average around high 80s. In May, they average mid 60s. So even though Australia alludes an eternal summer in imagination, I had to pack knowing that it will get a bit chilly toward the end of my stay.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3508\" data-orig-height=\"2556\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/f36a8eb5ab5c9d22a8da01d28b9e28d6/tumblr_inline_o1f6u8hsMu1qffdbv_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3508\" data-orig-height=\"2556\"/></figure><p>I also had to make sure that I didn‚Äôt pack too much because usually, I am either over-prepared or grossly under-prepared.

This week‚Äôs edition tackles division, isolation, and social relations.</em>\n</h1><p>The lament is familiar. The major political parties fail to attain\ncompromises and instead engage in demonizing each other. ¬†Extremists and demagogues who indulge in\nvituperation sometimes seize them. The citizenry, and especially the young,\nfeel disaffected from the entire political process. ¬†Observers attribute the current stalemate to\na host of vices: the corrupting influence of big money, the circus of the\nprimaries, the manipulation of voting districts, and the rise of social media,\nwhich divides rather than unites groups of potential voters. ¬†</p>\n<p>This is probably all true, but it stays on\nthe surface level of politics and far away from our mundane concerns. ¬†I suspect it mirrors what goes on underneath.\nThe term ‚Äúgerrymandering‚Äù (named after a long forgotten governor\nof Massachusetts) means to divide a territorial unit into election districts to\ngive one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts\nwhile concentrating the voting strength of the opposition in as few districts\nas possible. But aren‚Äôt we doing the same in social relations, the very\nfabric of our daily lives? ¬†I wish to\nsubmit to you the following paradox in our age of social media: ¬†the more we stay connected with friends,\nacquaintances, and strangers, the more we isolate ourselves into gated virtual\ncommunities of like-minded people. ¬†Connectivity\nleads to fragmentation. In social media life resembles a kaleidoscope of\nsolicitations, and we seek temporary refuge in fickle tribes, which are the\nelectronic districts of the similarly inclined.</p>\n<p>¬†When we go beyond the fickle in search of the\nmore stable and steadfast we land in the domain of identity politics. But this\nmakes a bad situation worse. Communication does not improve. If and when these ‚Äútribes‚Äù\nhave to share a public domain, if they are to avoid a war of all against all,\nthey agree on a compact of mutual respect that goes under the rubrics of ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù\nand ‚Äútolerance.‚Äù ¬†But at what price? ¬†The upshot is often a reluctance to say\nanything that might offend somebody, and so the common language descends to the\nlevel of the anodyne. We have a surfeit of messages, but we are starved of conversation. ¬†Certain names, books, topics and tropes are\nto be avoided in the name of a supposed harmony among those who do not really\nwish to engage each other in genuinely common pursuits. ¬†This is especially perverse in the case of\ninstitutions of higher learning that once were proud of the title of liberal\narts. ¬†For decades these bastions of\nacademic freedom protected the different and unpopular from the pressures of\noutside orthodoxy. ¬†But recently many of\nthese former bastions want to protect insiders from each other, lest they make\neach other uncomfortable with opinions that are not a repetition of their own. ¬†</p>\n<p>The guardians of the new orthodoxy are\nbureaucrats, not teachers. ¬†Socrates no\nlonger roams the corridors making everybody uncomfortable with challenging\nquestions. ¬†An army of professionals is\nreplacing the search for <em>veritas</em> by\nthe management of <em>in loco parentis</em>. ¬†Since colleges are very expensive\nundertakings in an increasingly unequal and competitive world, and since they\nare run like a business, there is a natural tendency to please customers more\nthan to engage students. ¬†As in the\nenclaves of Club Mediterranee, everything should be smooth, uncontroversial,\nand comfortable ‚Äìat a hefty price.</p>\n<p>We risk moving from <em>collegium</em> to Club Ed. The old ideal was of colleges and universities\nhelping to think creatively and enrich the spiritual and intellectual life of\nfaculty and students. ¬†The new model is\nreduced to a bunch of practical skills plus entertainment, with a supplement of\nthe therapeutic. ¬†<em>Caveat emptor</em>: ¬†Some daring instructor (soon to be suspended)\nmight assign <em>On Liberty</em> by John\nStuart Mill!</p>\n<p>Learn more about Professor Juan E Corradi <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%253A%252F%252Fsociology.as.nyu.edu%252Fobject%252Fjuancorradi.html&amp;t=N2VkZWE4OGM3YTA5YjA4MjkwMzhjYzljZTRjYzhkZGU5OGE5YTZlOCxibkFEMWZuYQ%253D%253D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137801750586,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZEE-ii20LdzWw","DateString":"2016-01-22","Text":"<p>It‚Äôs the night before I leave for Prague, and I‚Äôm feeling a whole tornado of emotions.¬†<br/></p><p>I‚Äôm nervous about living in a country where I can‚Äôt speak the language.

These items are comprised of things that can make my life in Italy just a little bit easier because they are things that I overlooked packing my first time around. Experience breeds wisdom &hellip; right? Anyway, here are my must-have items: <br/>\n-medicine <br/>\n      ~ this includes but is not limited to eye drops, cough drops, cold medicine, allergy medication, etc.<br/>\nThere are, of course, medicines in Italy, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be prepared with something that you trust to get rid of that unavoidable and  annoying cough or cold that creeps around at the beginning of the semester. <br/>\n-luggage locks<br/>\n      ~ yes this may be an item that you already use to secure your luggage but the trick is to bring extra locks for back packs (when staying in hostels or airbnbs to secure your belongings) or to have just in case one of your friends needs it.<br/>\n-phone plan<br/>\n      ~ let&rsquo;s face it, most of our communication takes place with our phones. I personally recommend either unlocking your phone before your departure if you know that you want to get a monthly plan when you arrive at your destination or asking your home provider if they have a plan that might work for you abroad. <br/>\n-money<br/>\n      ~this sounds like a no brainer but go into study abroad with a financial plan which includes your budget. Always have a plan B in case something goes wrong. I would not recommend money wiring, but I would highly suggest that you obtain some sort of bank account which someone back home also has access to because that way they can step in and help just in case something goes wrong.<br/>\n-personal hygiene care items<br/>\n      ~if you have a favorite toothpaste, deodorant, feminine care product, skincare item, etc you might want to bring it because chances are that you won&rsquo;t find that exact same product abroad. <br/>\n-positive mindset<br/>\n      ~ this is extremely important because you need to be open-minded in order to make the most of the incredible adventure that you are about to embark on. There will be ups and downs, but what matters the most is you learning and making the most of every experience that comes your way.</p>\n\n<p>Happy travels!<br/>\nUn bacio,<br/>\n-Amy</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137761429486,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZMxQ9y20JE9Vk","DateString":"2016-01-21","Text":"<p>People like Julia make the transient nature of our work difficult.

I‚Äôd written the script, assembled the crew, cast all the parts and now it was time to direct. On the first day of shooting I actually showed up to set early. Not on time - <i>early</i>.

Kind of.</p><p>Most directors have a reputation for being bullheaded and temperamental. I guess I had those moments over the years. But I wasn‚Äôt an asshole and it only happened when I was feeling particularly passionate about the project. That‚Äôs just the nature of being a director though.¬†</p><p>But I remember walking to set at 721 Broadway for day 2 of shooting when I ran into <i>him</i>. This guy I‚Äôd had a massive crush on since freshman orientation 2 years prior. The first time I laid eyes on him he was singing in the Black Student Union office. I just about melted at the sound of his voice. It was the end of everything for me. He knew it too. He knew I wanted him. He did not return those feelings though he did mess with my head for five years, but I digress.¬†</p><p>He intercepted me just as I was about to enter the building. We made small talk. I told him about my project. Or rather, I boasted about how awesome the project was going. For once, my mind was not on him and getting in his pants. I was thinking about my set, my crew, my actors. I was in director mode. I guess it came off as arrogant to this guy. Because he said so. He actually said I was being arrogant and I shouldn‚Äôt let this whole film business ‚Äúgo to my head.‚Äù¬†</p><p>Instantly, a switch went off in my brain.¬†</p><p>From that moment on I vowed I would not let the film business ‚Äúgo to my head.‚Äù Like a robot, my brain kept repeating that in my head over and over again until it stuck. Until I had it in my body. I went through the next couple of years of my career putting that into practice just in case he would see me in action again. Just in case I‚Äôd have the opportunity to show him I‚Äôd heeded his advice. Just in case it would make him love me.¬†</p><p>Keep in mind I was 20. I was horny for this guy, I was young and most importantly, I was <i>dumb. </i>If anyone was to say something like this to me today I would spit in their face. Because I wasn‚Äôt being arrogant or a jerk or rude. I was simply distracted and excited about shooting my project,which I‚Äôd graciously taken the time to talk to him about despite my being in a hurry to get to set. He just didn‚Äôt like the fact that I wasn‚Äôt drooling all over him.¬†</p><p>But of course I didn‚Äôt know that at the time.¬†</p><p>At one point, sometime after graduating, this guy and I had a falling out and we haven‚Äôt spoken since. I don‚Äôt actively try to remember him or anything he ever said to me. In fact, most days I don‚Äôt think of him at all. But every once in awhile, I find myself checking in with myself. Asking the usual questions,¬†‚Äúis there a kinder way I can phrase this? Am I coming across as arrogant? Will this upset someone if I say this? How can I shrink myself so that I seem humble and not intimidating?‚Äù¬†</p><p>I try to stop those thoughts. To remind myself that I am a kind person and I don‚Äôt intentionally try to hurt others. But when I‚Äôm reminding myself of that fact that I see myself and I know who I am better than that guy or anyone ever did or ever will, I‚Äôm thinking about him and that moment outside of Tisch.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs funny what sticks with you no matter how hard you work to forget.</p><p>I know now that changing who I am won‚Äôt make someone love me. <i>He</i> will never love me. So I don‚Äôt need to replay that moment in my head ever again. I don‚Äôt need to hold on to that unsolicited, inappropriate and unnecessary piece of advice.¬†</p><p>But one good thing came from that interaction. I‚Äôm always actively trying to practice kindness. Because as the saying goes, people may forget what you did and what you said but they‚Äôll never forget how you made them feel.¬†</p><p>I want people who work with me to always have a good feeling about me.

NYU‚Äôs president, John Sexton, who will soon pass his position on to Andrew Hamilton, spoke a few words before the performance. He primarily praised NYUSH students for taking a ‚Äúless conventional path‚Äù in their higher education.</p><p>‚ÄúThe theme of [the Reality Show] is, we‚Äôre here for each other,‚Äù said Sexton. ‚ÄúWe just need you to know that there are other people out there that care about you. Maybe you‚Äôll remember something that was said‚Äîor a song from the show.‚Äù</p><p>First written eleven years ago in New York City, this year‚Äôs Reality Show encompassed a wide range of topics relevant to any NYU student. Executed in several skits accompanied by songs and choreography, the show ultimately conveyed the message that NYU is, in fact, ‚Äúhere for you,‚Äù as Sexton said. No matter what problem an NYU student encounters ‚Äìacademic, health, social, or cultural‚Äì there is always hope and, as the show repeatedly points out, help can be found simply by calling the school‚Äôs Health and Wellness Center. ¬†</p><p>The show also emphasizes that NYUSH is unlike any other college in the world because of its international community. One of the first musical skits ‚Äìa piece about roommates‚Äì demonstrated that overcoming cultural barriers requires a willingness to embrace and understand one another‚Äôs differences. The show also included other relevant topics such as sexual consent, safe drinking, peer competition, fiscal responsibility, and body image.</p><p>The baseball skit threw the audience into uncontrollable laughter, as performers (Lilly Korinek, Oscar Fossum) educated a young student (Ben Weilun Zhang) about the rules of playing baseball, a euphemism for safe sex. ‚ÄúWhen you hit a home run, make sure that your glove‚Äôs on,‚Äù sang Fossum.</p><p>‚ÄúSo the whole point of baseball is getting a home run?‚Äù asked Ben Weilun Zhang.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, getting a home run is great, but some people don‚Äôt get past first base for a long time. Just remember to have fun and respect the other team‚Ä¶ Good luck, kid,‚Äù responded Korinek.</p><p>After a moment of silent confusion, Zhang responded: ‚ÄúWait‚Äì these kids are talking about baseball? I‚Äôm just looking for a condom‚Ä¶‚Äù The comment resulted in thunderous laughter.</p><p>Another skit satirized the academic pressure that many NYU students feel on a daily basis, which is influenced by the competitive environment fostered by their peers. Defne Inhan, in a skit about peer competition, ‚Äúcreated world peace.‚Äù ‚ÄúI created intergalactic peace,‚Äù shouted Cheryl Li in response. This type of competitive attitude is prevalent at many prestigious universities, and NYU is no exception. ¬†Sometimes it can be overwhelming when everyone is talking about internships, company start-ups, and building resumes when one is simply trying to pass a certain class. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your energy trying to be better than others,‚Äù concluded Korinek in a public-service announcement, similar to the type that followed each performance.</p><p>The show lasted about two hours, and if laughter were bricks, the performance could have built the Great Wall of China. Still, a few skits illuminated the more serious aspects of college life, such as abusive relationships and drug use, which the audience met with respective and completive silence. ¬†</p><p>‚ÄúI thought the Reality Show was a very genuine portrayal of life in Shanghai both for students and people in general. I appreciated the honesty in which the performances presented themselves on stage, and as an audience member I felt engaged as well as touched by various moments throughout the show,‚Äù said Lou Demetroulakos ‚Äô19 when asked about the show.</p><p>Orsi Liddiard ‚Äô19 said: ‚ÄúI thought they approached the topics in a very relatable way, meaning that people could understand what was going in in the show, and while doing so, draw parallels between the show and their own lives at NYU Shanghai.‚Äù</p><p>The Reality Show not only educated the audience about relevant social topics, but also entertained. Ultimately, the Reality Show‚Äôs greatest accomplishment was the encapsulation of the enterprising spirit of NYUSH‚Äîdiversity, inventiveness, ingenuousness, and fallibility. As Sexton said, ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs legal and moral do it once. Play another octave of the piano. Reach out to different people. That‚Äôs the vision of NYUSH and its global network.‚Äù</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137648280110,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20CUX8k","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Josh Fattal was one of three Americans detained by Iranian troops on July 31, 2009.

Just by hanging around or talking to students on campus, you can get a feel for the NYU lifestyle pretty quickly. While we‚Äôre all a little different, we can‚Äôt help but notice some similarities among those we see and meet at NYU.<br/></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Born and Raised</h2><p>Their navigation of the subway is flawless and their sense of fashion sophisticated. Their excitement to be in the City for Welcome Week is barely noticeable compared to yours. Who are they? New Yorkers, and it‚Äôs easy to tell.</p><!-- more --><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Low-Key Celebrity</h2><p>They may not be famous themselves, but their phone full of A-listers might convince you otherwise. Their #tbt is a picture of them sitting on Martin Scorsese‚Äôs lap, and that late night Facebook check-in is tagged with Lorde.¬†</p><p><br/></p><h2>The One Who LOVES New York City</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/d470d4a52c8f68b80e4c3891552c93f2/tumblr_inline_nr6tdy6s471ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Studying in New York is great ‚Äî no doubt about that ‚Äî and they make it well known. Well, at least their Instagram does. It‚Äôs an agglomeration of overfiltered pictures of the Manhattan skyline with lengthy captions about how the city has changed them. We‚Äôll cut them some slack, because we totally get it.</p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Purple Bleeder</h2><p>They‚Äôve been involved with student leadership before classes even started, attend all undergrad events, and have enough NYU swag to dress in purple for a couple weeks straight. We kinda admire their Violet pride, tbh.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Bobstworm</h2><p>You don‚Äôt know their names, you don‚Äôt know their years, but you know their faces. You always see them in that same spot at Bobst ‚Äî studying, eating, or sleeping ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs the first week of classes or the last day of finals. But if you always see them there, aren‚Äôt you a Bobstworm too?</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Incoming Transfer</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/07f98a0f14eb0e574bf635bfc440936a/tumblr_inline_nr6tfwTQ8v1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>You know you‚Äôre talking to a transfer student when you‚Äôre both juniors and they don‚Äôt know how to pronounce Bobst. But we‚Äôll let that slide, because they made the smart choice to transfer from wherever they were before. </p><p><br/></p><h2>The Outgoing Transfer</h2><p>You should have seen it coming ; they had been wearing that Columbia sweatshirt for a while now.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Singer</h2><p>They bring Broadway to your bedroom. They play multiple instruments, practice their arpeggios every morning, and sing in the dining halls around their singer peers. They‚Äôre your enemy at 7AM on a Monday, and your best friend at karaoke at 1AM on a Saturday.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Student Film Director</h2><p>They collect tripods and camera lenses and are usually seen in Washington Square Park giving directions to a confused group of ‚Äúactors.‚Äù They‚Äôre always on the lookout for ‚Äúactors‚Äù such as you, humble student. Get ready.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Artsy One</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"440\" data-orig-height=\"205\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/60a4b932be806a49c83046cb8d86558e/tumblr_inline_nr6tl4rKnu1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Studying a blend of social sciences and visual arts courses, they are always up-to-date on the latest happenings of the many underground worlds. Every social media platform they use is a collection of abstract art photographs captioned with elusive phrases that leave you confused. They‚Äôre just on a different level.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Vegetarian</h2><p>While their motives may vary, they all carefully monitor their diets and make sure everyone is aware of it. You sometimes wonder if they‚Äôre serious when asking for the vegetarian menu at Just Salad&hellip;?</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Business Student</h2><p>They‚Äôre often found walking in packs, wearing the business attire they received for Christmas with their computer briefcases in hand and business card ready. How do you know they go to business school? They‚Äôll tell you.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Entrepreneur</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/c581fe461f71bd30f1252d420ee0e0f2/tumblr_inline_nr6uf7MeIl1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>They try to attend as many networking events as possible, with the strong hope that their idea be the next <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/about/university-initiatives/entrepreneurship-at-nyu/inspire/success-stories/etsy.html\">Etsy</a>.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Greek Lifer</h2><p>Yes, it‚Äôs a thing here, despite our lack of frat houses and lawn parties. They move in packs and are actually some of the most tight knit communities at NYU.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The ‚ÄúPromoter‚Äù</h2><p>Usually a friend of a friend, they have enough contacts to guarantee you *free* and awesome* NYU rooftop parties almost every night of the year if you say their name.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Freshman</h2><p>Lanyard.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137641502669,"NoteCount":9,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20C4gVD","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137638938423,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20BwuSt","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137631705294,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_3Q5l20BVIZE","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Professor Cathcart discusses the Administration program with her new students. #nyucn #purplepride #instanyu #nyu  (at NYU Kimmel Center for University Life)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137627626917,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z72TWy20BFksb","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Lots of #purplepride today!

Sorry for not posting lately, but with the madness of finals and the holidays I haven‚Äôt really had much time to post. I will try to post more frequently in the new year! As I reflect on 2015, I can‚Äôt help but smile at all of the amazing memories and opportunities that I have been fortunate enough to have this year. I‚Äôve definitely grown out of my shell and learned to explore things on my own. I‚Äôve done things out of my comfort zone which has allowed me to pursue things that I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd be strong enough to do. I moved to Italy! Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would be as independent and adventurous as I am now. I am so incredibly grateful for all of my family and friends who have been supporting me and encouraging me to live life to the fullest. I‚Äôve learned to take risks because sometimes those reap the greatest rewards. It‚Äôs good to get out of the ‚Äúnorm‚Äù once in awhile because that allows you to see what you are truly capable of. I‚Äôm so fortunate to be where I am today and be able to discover what the world has to offer. Finally, one of the  greatest things I have learned this year is  to surround myself with people who constantly encourage me to follow my dreams and empower me to aspire to be the best possible version of myself! I hope that everyone is doing well and I am extremely excited for what is to come! A presto!</p>\n<p>Un bacio,</p>\n<p>-A</p></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137373873285,"NoteCount":32,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-y7lI5","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137353934286,"NoteCount":20,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1-wxhNE","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137349828442,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZfcBCt1-wi0zQ","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137334147883,"NoteCount":7,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zzjwpw1-vmCih","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Holmes_Bobst_Library\">Bobst Library</a>, NYU.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137320672529,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJLCvx1-uyoqH","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>Guatemala #guatemala #medicaloutreach #volunteersaroundtheworld #medical #medicine #nyu #newyorkuniversity (at San Pedro La Laguna, Lago De Atitl√°n, Guatemala)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137320552792,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTQe7x1-uyLbO","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; in New York.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137319674300,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZtLU-v1-uu-6y","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>@p.ekyi/instagram<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137303397232,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zd8MSx1-twvDm","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>üîØ | #Museum #NYU #NewYorkCity #EmpireStateOfMind #Magic #Occult #Art  (at 80WSE Gallery)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137303328152,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zd8MSx1-tweMO","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>Everyone should check out the NYU exhibit, The Language of Birds: Occult &amp; Art | #Occult #Art #Magic #NYU #NewYorkCity #EmpireStateOfMind #Museum  (at 80WSE Gallery)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137300806835,"NoteCount":7,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-tn0op","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>100 NYU students, faculty and alumni wrote, directed, shot, produced or performed in movies at this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival: <b><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1n64rt2\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1n64rt2</a></b></p><p>Photo by Jemal Countess / Courtesy of Sundance Institute<br/><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137296671697,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTrMkq1-tXFFH","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137244355004,"NoteCount":95,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_i3zj1-qPgcy","DateString":"2016-01-13","Text":"<p>In this shot I couldn‚Äôt really choose which colors to take, so I took both.

Cause that‚Äôs kind of what I‚Äôve been doing :)<br/></p><p>So I just finished my third semester, and classes are definitely getting more challenging.</p><p>I accomplished my goal of writing more comedy, and I think my confidence is slightly raising in that field! Which is great because that‚Äôs literally what I want to do for a career and I have to stop being so intimidated by it. I was writing more because I had to for some comedy classes I was in, so I‚Äôm hoping my motivation doesn‚Äôt go away next semester!¬†</p><p>For those that don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm concentrating in¬†‚Äúpolitical satire‚Äù in Gallatin, so I basically want to write and produce comedy for TV. Last semester I took 2 comedy classes, which really helped me focus on what I want to do. I‚Äôm taking fewer comedy-centric classes next semester, but I‚Äôm taking more classes to expand my concentration and studies as a whole. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:</p><p>1 TV writing class, in which I‚Äôm going to write a script for a half-hour comedy!<br/>1 class that‚Äôs technically about politics (‚ÄùPolitics‚Äù is in the title, but I‚Äôm taking this class mostly to satisfy 3 different requirements!!!)<br/>1 Producing class for my producing minor, I think I‚Äôm also writing a TV script in this class, not too sure&hellip;<br/>1 film class that‚Äôs a prereq for a comedy study abroad program I‚Äôm applying for! The study abroad program is literally called¬†‚ÄúComedy Writing and Production for Television,‚Äù so I‚Äôm realllllllly excited about it :)<br/>And I‚Äôm taking a 2 credit course that I created about Political Satire in Late Night!!! We‚Äôll be analyzing how shows like The Daily Show or the Colbert Report affect political activism and participation. This class is really going to help fine-tune my concentration!</p><p>I also switched advisors and the switch will be taking effect this semester! My new advisor is also conveniently teaching that TV writing class, and he teaches a lot of comedy writing, so I‚Äôm excited to learn a lot from him.<br/></p><p>Overall, my studies are really pointing me in the direction that I want to go in, but I‚Äôm pretty clueless in the internship area. I need to get an internship somehow related to comedy, but the deadline to intern for most TV networks was months ago. Hopefully I can find an internship I‚Äôm passionate about!</p><p>I just realized this entire post was about my academics and not much about my actual life at NYU&hellip; I guess that‚Äôs just where my focus is!¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642578216,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GY4Se","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Washed </i>by¬†Rikke Louis Schjoedt</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642476856,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GXhiu","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Washed</i> by¬†Rikke Louis Schjoedt</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642418761,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GXTX9","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Ookie Cookie </i>by Francesca Mirabella</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136636815626,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-GC5aA","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136636484434,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z8ck6r1-GAqjI","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":"<p>üôÇ back 2 school üôÉ</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136635759829,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZtN4ux1-G83pL","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":"<p>Are you a student at New York University (NYU)?

It was brutal.\nI never thought it would be because I came to New York to attend a two-year\nacting conservatory. I didn‚Äôt mind working odd jobs when I first started out of\nthe gate. I was all about ‚Äúpaying my dues‚Äù. But as the years stacked, my ‚Äúdues‚Äù\nweren‚Äôt moving me in the direction I had hoped. I soon realized I didn‚Äôt have\nmuch to offer the working world. I had zero office skills. Without a degree, I was\nmet with many closed doors of potential opportunities at media companies that\nmight have offered a new perspective on life.</p><p>I grew envious\nand felt inferior to my peers who had completed their education. They appeared stronger\nat problem solving and critical thinking than I was. I was always searching for\nways to make myself feel whole while I pursued acting. I challenged myself with\nsituations that were not in my comfort zone, I traveled solo to Europe and\nAsia, I took tons of classes, attended various lectures and museum exhibits,\nbut in my mind I was always coming up short and didn‚Äôt know how to catch up. </p><p>For years going\nback to school was never an option that was on the table because I saw it as\ngiving up on my passion to be the actress that brought me to New York in the\nfirst place.</p><p>Passing on learning\nin the classroom for 30 + courses came back to haunt me years later. It also\nmeant I passed on all the programs that colleges offered to help develop\nstudents in myriad ways. I missed the opportunities to try new things in a safe\nenvironment, creating passion projects without being certain how, and hosting\nevents within school clubs. </p><p>College\ncreates a protected space to not know, fail, and build upon those lessons all\nin preparation to enter the world as a well-rounded individual. When you are\nout in the world, you are expected to know fundamental skills. You aren‚Äôt\nequipped with an overstocked supply of highly credible potential mentors at\nyour fingertips willing to help you navigate life the way you do when you are\nin a college or university setting.</p><p>Perhaps if there\nisn‚Äôt a solution to offer students an affordable higher education, the shift\nneeds to happen within the pressure society places on students to finish within\na four-year period. Perhaps we need to create more programs where students can\nwork full time to offset the debt. Perhaps we as a society need to encourage\nstudents to attend school at their own pace. </p><p>I think higher\neducation is invaluable and a necessity that needs to be fought for with great\nvigilance to ensure it happens for each one of us. ¬†I don&rsquo;t think the question should be if students\nshould attend college; I think the question should be how we can restructure\ncollege to fit into the new mold into which our society is developing.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136560674866,"NoteCount":16,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZFnX5y1-BfeWo","DateString":"2016-01-03","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136553839102,"NoteCount":12,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-BFZd_","DateString":"2016-01-03","Text":"<p>How many things can you do in one day just using an NYU ID?

Some people work or find internships. I guess this leads into your next question: <b>How hard is it to make friends/socialize with other students?</b> Some people find it pretty hard. Because the thing with NYU is that you are living in a city. There‚Äôs a whole lot of independence there and everyone is sort of doing their own thing. BUT. You still have all of your classes and there are the clubs I already mentioned. But for me, it was super easy. All thanks to study abroad. I spent my freshman year in London, then went right on to Florence. I actually just came back from another semester in London. Study abroad is a great chance to meet friends- there are less people and you are thrown into an environment where you can constantly go on trips or explore. It‚Äôs wonderful. *that doesn‚Äôt mean that studying abroad is perfect, mind you. it can be quite difficult being away from your security net and that is totally normal*</p><p><b>Is it a safe environment?</b> Oh yeah.

On August 25th, I will be hopping on a plane to Istanbul, Turkey with no intention of returning to the United States until May/June 2016. After spending a few days in Istanbul, I will travel to Prague and spend a few more with family before heading off to Paris. For the next nine months, I will call Paris my home as I spend my first year at NYU studying in France.</p>\n<p>Receiving my acceptance letter in March, my interest was piqued by the notion that I could spend my first year abroad. To be completely honest, NYU was one of my safety schools during the college application process. But after thoughtful consideration about who I am and the person I want to be, I decided to take the leap into New York City and (what I hope will be) the greatest experience of my life thus far. Studying abroad in Paris was definitely a major factor in my choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"denied:%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.frommadison.com/packing-for-a-year-of-study-abroad/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">Read more.</a>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":135338831685,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZmIQzt1_2qgz5","DateString":"2015-12-16","Text":"<p>Dec. 12 - Another amazing collaboration with #johnshopkins #cty and #nyu at the Pathways to College event #admissions #latergram</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":135336403932,"NoteCount":4,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZLMEdo1_2hQFS","DateString":"2015-12-16","Text":"<p>My best friend got into her top school and everybody should go congratulate <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mnMyICy4ycw3iyXicuWbu8g\" target=\"_blank\">@bby-gal</a> for being amazing.

And I don‚Äôt know how to generally explain it. So I‚Äôll just talk about how this came to be for this particular reason.</p><p>I‚Äôm currently writing a story where one of my characters attends NYU. Being that I have never been on an NYU campus, I needed to see what a typical NYU dorm may look like. Low and behold, they‚Äôre all bloody different depending on the building &amp; neighborhood, but that‚Äôs good¬†‚Äòol Manhattan for you.</p><p>So I searched on youtube and I watched one video with two girls and the next with a guy who is seemingly a pro skater. His video was more quirky &amp; humorous and I thoroughly enjoyed it. His roommate James was filming the video and he introduced him briefly. I don‚Äôt know what it was about James but I was interested. I always felt that NYU students had more going on about them than any other college. It‚Äôs NYC, everyone is artsy in some form. I wanted to know more about James lol. So I found out he‚Äôs a film student&hellip;that was a plus. Not to mention he had a rad hairdo &amp; facial scruff going on&hellip;another plus. By now I feel like a stalker but who cares, he‚Äôs interesting and I found his Vimeo account because (1) he‚Äôs a film student, of COURSE he‚Äôs gonna be on Vimeo and (2) I wanted to check out his filming style considering I‚Äôll be going back to college soon as a film major (hopefully, still waiting to see). Anyway&hellip;</p><p>I guess the overall bottom line is that I notice the people in the background. I stumble upon people and I see what their friends are about because, despite how much I might be against the whole liking-human-beings type of thing, I know there are some very interesting people walking this earth. You know, the type that do NOT deserve to be put on an island with no food. Awesome people still exist! So&hellip;that‚Äôs a thing I do once in a blue moon. It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs like how people watch a youtube video and 2 hours later, they‚Äôre watching a cat fight a laser.</p><p>Anyhoo&hellip;I thought I‚Äôd share one of James‚Äôs videos in an upcoming post. We may not know each other, James, but I hope you get far in life or wherever your heart desires.</p><p>x</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134709991908,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZSj_gj1zTLrda","DateString":"2015-12-07","Text":"<p>Foxy Roxy!

Into the wee hours of the night, no one is at Bobst just to pass the time, they&rsquo;re there to work‚Ä¶ or at least pretend to work. Here are the NYU students you inevitably will see in Bobst‚Ä¶ at night.</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/99aab6a7cac815e3b10bfdd5173e436d/tumblr_inline_nxxgvlXvcx1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><!-- more --><br/><h2>The Sleeper</h2><p>Whether they‚Äôre snuggled up in a comfy chair they‚Äôve managed to claim or hunched over a desk, this person can be found on any floor of Bobst on any day of the year. We get it though, it‚Äôs been a long day.</p><br/><h2>The Insomniac</h2><p>This person has obviously been awake for 24+ hours. Their unblinking eyes have overcome the heaviness of exhaustion and just vowed to stay open for the rest of eternity. Most commonly seen during exam season.¬†</p>\n<br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/1ce2c69d92fb0b09880467ca4f5d680c/tumblr_inline_nywkgth8xS1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"/></figure><br/><h2>The Texter</h2><p>This person has been on their phone for two hours straight! Who are you texting so furiously right now? Hopefully a study partner?</p><br/><h2>The Disappearing Act</h2><p>Their stuff has been taking up a cubicle space all night, yet they are nowhere to be found. Did they get lost on the way to the printer? Did they swing by home to grab dinner? Did they never really exist at all? We‚Äôll never know&hellip;</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/463c7d6ea57fc26b7c59c48ec17efc6c/tumblr_inline_nywkhiVBKK1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><br/><h2>The Casual Diner</h2><p>We didn‚Äôt think it could be done but this person managed to bring a full five-course meal into the confines of Bobst.

Hey, wanna share?</p><br/><h2>The Social Butterfly</h2><p>It‚Äôs a misconception that Bobst is eerily quiet at night. It‚Äôs actually quite loud thanks to this person.

Beginning with \nAleister Crowley‚Äôs tarot paintings and Austin Osman Spare‚Äôs automatic \ndrawings of the 1920s, the exhibition traces nearly a century of occult \nart, including Leonora Carrington and Kurt Seligmann‚Äôs surrealist \nexplorations, Kenneth Anger and Ira Cohen‚Äôs ritualistic experiments in \nfilm and photography, and the mystical probings of contemporary \nvisionaries such as Francesco Clemente, Kiki Smith, Paul Laffoley, \nBREYER P-ORRIDGE, and Carol Bove.</p><p>The concerns and influences of \neach of these artists are as eclectic as the styles in which they work. \nWhile several of the pieces deal with ‚Äúhigh‚Äù or ceremonial magic, others\n draw from so-called ‚Äúlow magic‚Äù practices and have deeply chthonic \nroots. The approaches in technique are varying as well, with some doing \nyears of research and preparation for the act of creation, and others \nworking entirely intuitively. Regardless of method, Language of the Birds\n suggests that all are part of the same lineage: one that pulls on \nthreads from the esoteric web of alchemy, Hermeticism, Spiritualism, \nTheosophy, divination and witchcraft.</p><p>The exhibition takes its \nname from the historical and cross-cultural notion that there is a magic\n language via which only the initiated can communicate. ¬†Often referred \nto as the ‚Äúlanguage of the birds,‚Äù it is a system rumored to operate in \nsymbols, and to be a vehicle for revealing hidden truths and igniting \nmetamorphic sparks.</p><p>The artists in Language of the Birds \ncan be considered magicians, then, when seen through this mythopoeic \nlens. A visual vocabulary is offered up by them, so that we all might be\n initiated into their imaginal mystery cults and dialog with the \nineffable. They speak to us in secret tongues, cast spells, and employ \npictures for the purpose of activating profound change in both \nthemselves and in us. ¬†By going within, then drawing streams of imagery \nforth through their creations, each of these artists seeks to render the\n invisible visible, to materialize the immaterial, and to tell us that \nwe, too, can enter numinous realms.</p><p><b>Participating Artists</b></p><p>Kenneth\n Anger * Anohni (FKA Antony Hegarty) * Laura Battle * Jordan Belson * \nAlison Blickle * Carol Bove * Jesse Bransford * BREYER P-ORRIDGE * John \nBrill * Robert Buratti * Elijah Burgher * Cameron * Leonora Carrington *\n Francesco Clemente * Ira Cohen * Brian Cotnoir * Aleister Crowley * \nEnrico Donati * El Gato Chimney * Leonor Fini * JFC Fuller * Helen \nRebekah Garber * Rik Garrett * Delia Gonzalez * Jonah Groeneboer * \nJuanita Guccione * Brion Gysin * Frank Haines * Barry William Hale * \nValerie Hammond * Ken Henson * Bernard Hoffman * Nino Japaridze * Gerome\n Kamrowski * Leo Kenney * Paul Laffoley * Adela Leibowitz * Darcilio \nLima * Angus MacLise * Ann McCoy * Rithika Merchant * William Mortensen *\n Rosaleen Norton * Micki Pellerano * Ryan M Pfeiffer &amp; Rebecca Walz *\n Max Razdow * Ron Reg√©, Jr. * Kurt Seligmann * Harry Smith * Kiki Smith *\n Xul Solar * Austin Osman Spare * Charles Stein * Shannon Taggart * \nGordon Terry * Scott Treleaven * Panos Tsagaris * Charmion von Wiegand *\n Robert Wang * Peter Lamborn Wilson * Lionel Ziprin</p><p><b>Special Events Related to the Exhibition</b></p><p>Weds, Jan 13: Opening Reception ¬† 6-8pm</p><p>Weds, Jan 27: Performance of ‚ÄúThe Language,‚Äù a theatrical piece written by playwright Matthew Freeman, commissioned for Language of the Birds ¬† ¬†7pm</p><p>Fri, Feb 5 ‚Äì Sun, Feb 7: <a href=\"http://www.phantasmaphile.com/occult-humanities/\">The Occult Humanities Conference</a>\n at NYU Steinhardt ‚Äì a weekend long symposium of 14 lectures and \nperformances which explore the influence of magical thought upon art, \nhistory, and contemporary culture</p><p>Weds, Feb 10: ‚ÄúArt Workings‚Äù Lectures and panel discussion with Professor Susan L.

Most of the time, you wave and they pretend to not see. Then the two of you go on with your lives, easy peasy. But here at NYU, it‚Äôs a little different. There are SO many of us in a particular area at one time that run-ins happen practically every hour. Since no one likes an awkward moment, learn the ins and outs of turning that awkward encounter into an awesome one.¬†<br/></p><br/><h2>Laundry Room </h2><a href=\"http://dontbematerialistic.tumblr.com/post/56164983908\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/6869aadb0bb17c8158495d522604c564/tumblr_mqbgbaTHyZ1rx9n8ho1_400.gif\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/><figure></figure></a><p>\tSometimes the perfect time to do your laundry lines up with that floormate you sort of know but whose name escapes you. Pro Tip: Just bite the bullet and ask them their name! Another friend in your building means another person for Netflix-binging nights. </p><!-- more --><br/><h2>Residence Hall ¬†</h2><a href=\"http://dormtrends.tumblr.com/post/95620092900/finally\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/a6dda19387c26bda28b62732a04aa379/tumblr_nanryx1igK1rz4wo0o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tGetting to know your roommates at first can be a little tricky, especially when one is up until 4AM and the other wakes up at 5AM. Pro Tip: Arrange for a roommate ‚Äúfamily‚Äù dinner. It gives you an opportunity to talk about what‚Äôs going on in your room while also eating. It‚Äôs the best of both worlds. </p><br/><h2>Dining Hall </h2><a href=\"http://malabellum.tumblr.com/post/92272095737\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/3afc002bcc21730fe008bb2116326318/tumblr_n8yy0euJ3b1t1udzmo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\"/></a><p>\tStuffing your face in the dining hall is a sight that only a select few of your friends have been approved to see. But at this point in college, people don‚Äôt even think twice about seeing other people eat to their heart‚Äôs content. Pro Tip: Always try to keep an open chair at your table. After all, what‚Äôs a better bonding activity than face-stuffing Palladium brunch?</p><br/><h2>Starbucks </h2><a href=\"http://fiercegifs.tumblr.com/post/99908994025\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/378667dd1a6883801522f0f03f0db1b6/tumblr_nde1p5Pjqm1rfduvxo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tCoffee is the answer to everything, except for when you run into someone you haven‚Äôt seen since Welcome Week at the campus Starbucks. Pro Tip: Say hello and bring up something you saw them post on Facebook or Instagram. Conversation started! </p><br/><h2>Bars </h2><a href=\"http://howimetyourmotherguys.tumblr.com/post/54345725521\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/c189b46f74f7c505634aad338c75e0e9/tumblr_mp9j71Trrv1s5ewi4o1_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tWhen will the awkward encounters end? Never. Because that‚Äôs life. But it‚Äôs not always awful. Seeing a professor at bar may seem like the end of the world, but it gives you an opportunity to see what they are like outside of the classroom. Pro Tip: Rather than avoiding eye contact, greet them like the grown-up that you are! </p><br/><h2>Subway </h2><a href=\"http://britneyaddiction.tumblr.com/post/87567334309/this-is-perfectly-normal-x\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/dd8eec8981350071fe6ee1b565515299/tumblr_n6iy0x4fiN1qd8zg3o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>Seeing someone you know on the platform may seem like a damper on that majestic feeling of independence, but it really gives an opportunity to test your quick conversation skills.

You didn‚Äôt take the hike to Bobst to have a conversation about the latest episode of ‚ÄúOrange is the New Black,‚Äù but the person sharing your desk might believe that you did. Pro Tip: Tell them that you have to study at the moment, but you‚Äôd love to catch up during a coffee break.¬†</p><br/><h2>The Classroom</h2><a href=\"http://thevoodoothatyoudowoo.tumblr.com/post/43418657443\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/57152d3b3277441138cc0e2293edc6bb/tumblr_mi2364jtuH1qbn5f7o1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tTalking to people in class can be inexplicably hard. You‚Äôre both there for the same reason, yet finding a connection to a classmate is like tapping your head and rubbing your belly at the same time: difficult, but not impossible.

Not only is sipping on an iced beverage just a quick way to get you cold on the inside, your hands ‚Äî mittens or not ‚Äî will FREEZE holding your drink. Opt for that toasty dark roast or hot cocoa instead (your fingers and body will thank you).</p>\n<br/><h2>3.

Freezing fingers means slower texting, so keep them warm to make sure your emoji game stays strong. Likewise, your ears need some lovin‚Äô too.

The show starts at a point when she had\nended her superhero career and entered the private investigations field, using\nher detective skills mostly to spy on cheating spouses. Until one case, where\nshe‚Äôs looking for a missing college student, leads her back to a man with\nmind-controlling abilities, who is obsessed with her. What appealed to me about\nthis show was that it addresses issues relating to gender, race, discrimination\namong many others, without deviating from its narrative taking place in a world\nwhere superhuman abilities exist, and that its characters can‚Äôt be\ncompartmentalized into good or bad and are more complex individuals. I cropped\nscenes from the first few episodes of the show, rearranged them in an order\nthat would help get my message across and used text slides to transition\nbetween segments to point the viewer‚Äôs mind to think in a certain direction.</p><p> ¬† ¬† This show\nsucceeds in getting a true feminist perspective because it is created by a\nwoman ‚Äì Melissa Rosenberg ‚Äì about a woman and covers many aspects of being a\nwoman like coping with living in a patriarchal society, facing sexism and other\nkinds of problems. In a ‚Äòpolitically aware‚Äô society, a show has to have a\ndiverse cast to avoid criticism and the show manages to include a variety demographics\nincluding Blacks, and lesbians, among others. But it‚Äôs notable how this show\nuses this diversity. In her essay ‚ÄòEating The Other‚Äô, Bel Hooks writes that\n‚Äúlike the ‚Äúprimitivism‚Äù Hal Foster maintains ‚Äúabsorbs the primitive in part via\nthe concept of affinity‚Äù contemporary notions of ‚Äúcrossover‚Äù expand the\nparameters of cultural production to enable the voice of the non-white Other to\nbe heard by a larger audience even as it denies the specificity of that voice,\nor as it recoups it for its own use (21).‚Äù In other words, she‚Äôs trying to say\nthat although ‚Äúthe Other‚Äù or the minority is included in the cultural\nproductions, and are given a platform to reach a wider audience, the\nspecificity of their conditions or their own feelings fail to be portrayed in a\nnarrative where they aren‚Äôt the lead characters. The show <i>Jessica Jones</i> accepts this limitation and although it includes\nthese different groups, it doesn‚Äôt deviate from the perspective of the white\nfemale protagonist. So instead of getting deep into problems the Black community\nfaces, it‚Äôll show us this issue in context of how it relates to the\nprotagonist. For example when she uses the tendency of people to profile a\nBlack male as an attacker to break divert people‚Äôs attention and break into a\nhospital to steal drugs. </p><p> ¬† ¬† Furthermore, Marvel\nuses super-humans and the problems they face when dealing with other people to\nsymbolize discrimination of any kind like it did with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/04/25/bryan_singer_x_men_2_interview.shtml\">the\nX-men series</a>. Since these people don‚Äôt belong to any race or social class\nthat usually face discrimination, their abilities provide yet another element\nthat could lead to discrimination. This is obvious when Jessica is grouped with\nother ‚Äúgifted‚Äù people for ‚Äúthe incident‚Äù in New York that she had nothing to do\nwith, and is facing a hate crime because of that. The ‚Äúincident‚Äù they are\ntalking about is one that occurred in <i>The\nAvengers </i>movie when aliens attacked the earth.</p><p> ¬† ¬† This show concurs\nwith the same arc that Linda Williams associates with the body genres ‚Äì female victimization.\nThis show loosely falls under the genre of drama and thriller, and Williams‚Äô\nobservations can be used to study it. In talking about the psychoanalytic\nsystem of analysis that‚Äôs influential in film study, she claims that these\ngenres are marked by an excess. ‚ÄúThe categories of fetishism, voyeurism, sadism\nand masochism‚Äù are frequently invoked to describe the pleasures of film\nspectatorship according to Williams. ‚ÄúPerversions are usually defined as\nexcesses, specifically as excesses which are deflected away from ‚Äúproper‚Äù end goals\nonto substitute goals or objects ‚Äì fetishes instead of genitals, looking\ninstead of touching,etc.‚Äù (6). This fits well in this case where the antagonist\nis obsessed with the female protagonist and the moment this usually strong\nwoman appears to be the most fearful is when she realizes that he‚Äôs been\nwatching her and has a collection of her photos. He even blackmails her to send\nhim a picture of her everyday ‚Äì to feed his voyeurism. The antagonist adopts\nwhat Mulvey calls the extreme of scopophilia, ‚Äúfixated into a perversion,\nproducing obsessive voyeurs or Peeping Toms, whose only sexual satisfaction can\ncome from watching, in an active controlling sense, an objectified other‚Äù (835).</p><p> ¬† ¬† Williams talks\nexplains an argument advanced by Carol Clover, which suggests that ‚Äúpleasure,\nfor a masculine-identified viewer, oscillates between identifying with the\ninitial passive powerlessness of the abject and terrorized girl-victim of\nhorror and her later, active empowerment‚Äù (6-7). This show to some degree has\nfallen into this category where even a woman with super strength meets a man\nstronger than her ‚Äì due to his mind-controlling powers ‚Äì and she‚Äôs become a girl-victim\nof this man trying to dominate her. It started off digressing from the image of\na powerless woman, so the question is whether it‚Äôs going to progress into the classic\nempowerment of this now-helpless woman or do the writers have a surprise in\nstore for us?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133899281209,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZDPmJv1yj1ECv","DateString":"2015-11-25","Text":"<p>Considering transferring out of my college in the mountains and looking into NYU or Columbia, anybody have any advice about living in the city??</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133893847851,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z-Z5-x1yiiVih","DateString":"2015-11-25","Text":"<p>I&rsquo;m graduating what #nyu #seniors?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133892451211,"NoteCount":5,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZmxRXw1yidAkB","DateString":"2015-11-24","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133891550144,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZX1qrl1yiZkl0","DateString":"2015-11-24","Text":"Freshman Year: I'm only going to eat at the dining hall when my friends are available.\nJunior Year: Who cares.

A white person will not be systematically prejudiced against (on an INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL) because they are white. Studies have shown that, when given identical resumes except for the names (where one sounded white and the other sounded nonwhite), employers tended to react more positively to those with white names. THAT is systematic institutional racism. It&rsquo;s not an individual economic issue&ndash;&ldquo;I struggled, too!&rdquo; does not mean that people of color are by and large exempt from struggling&ndash;it&rsquo;s a sociopolitical issue on a group scale. People of color create student unions in order to advocate for equality in a predominantly white-biased society. White students are not &ldquo;supposed to be ashamed of being white,&rdquo; nor are they told that their voice doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s that a student union exists in order to give less privileged and largely marginalized groups a place to have their concerns voiced. White students do not fit into either of those criteria, so therefore a White Student Union is unnecessary.\n\n<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133820031689,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZErM3j1yeIwB9","DateString":"2015-11-23","Text":"<p>They‚Äôre legitimately the nicest people ever.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133820027494,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZErM3j1yeIv9c","DateString":"2015-11-23","Text":"<p>Living in the NYC, where everything is so accessible.

We have lots to share with you, so stay tuned.<br/></p><p>On Tuesday October 20th, NYU played host to the PRSA Tri-State Conference. While most of the day‚Äôs events were geared toward PR professionals, there was a student session, where three PR pro‚Äôs, including an SVP at Edelman and the Founder of Day One Agency, shared tips for making a successful career in PR after graduation. Here‚Äôs a roundup of some of their best advice:</p><p>1) <b>Don‚Äôt underestimate the importance of informational interviewing.</b> All the panelists stressed that PR is built on connections and relationships, so the best way to lay the groundwork for a successful career is to grow your network while you‚Äôre still in school. Speaker Rob Longert said that 90% of the people his firm, Day One Agency, has hired have come from referrals, while Lisa Kovitz, an SVP at Edelman, claimed that connections have helped her land every position she‚Äôs ever had.</p><p>2) <b>Entering the workforce without experience doesn‚Äôt have to hurt you.</b>¬†The panelists said that they will hire people with no prior PR experience if they can show in their application how their other experiences, such as summer jobs, volunteering, or coursework, gave them skills that will enable them to succeed in PR. Lisa suggested that another way to get noticed is to create a blog or social media account that represents who you are and what you are passionate about and good at, as she claimed that she has hired people after being impressed by their online presence.</p><p>3) <b>Make sure to take an active role as an intern.</b> The panelists noted that interns are often so grateful to be at a company that they are willing to do anything there. While doing scut work with a good attitude is important, interns should also tell their supervisors what they want to learn and gain from the experience. Companies like interns who can contribute fresh ideas and perspectives, so by making your voice heard you are helping them and yourself.</p><p>¬†On Wednesday October 21st, Chris Brown, an Account Director at top PR firm Grayling, came to our meeting. He spoke and answered questions about internship and post-graduation opportunities at the global agency. You can learn more about current and future positions at:¬†<a href=\"http://www.grayling.com/global/careers\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.grayling.com/global/careers</a>.<br/></p><p>On Tuesday October 27th, we heard a presentation from a Vice President at MOGUL, a ¬†publishing platform for women that was named one of the top 7 NYC startups of 2015. MOGUL is currently seeking contributors¬†\n\nwho will share their knowledge and opinions with others by writing articles, sharing job listings, recommending products, and more.

Bill also noted that being a good writer is the key to success in any field.</p><p>2) <b>Finding a mentor is imperative to achieving success.</b>¬†He mentioned that he has had many mentors throughout his long career, and that all of them have helped him greatly. He stressed that your mentors don‚Äôt have to be people you work for, and suggested looking online (such as on LinkedIn) to find and reach out to people whose career path interests you.</p><p>3) <b>Promote yourself whenever possible.</b> While Bill had a lot of great one-liners, the one that stood out the most was ‚Äúself-promotion is your second job.‚Äù Although no one likes to feel that they‚Äôre bragging or coming off as arrogant when they talk to others, especially strangers, it is necessary to quickly and effectively convey your strengths to new people you meet, as you never know who might be impressed and open more doors.</p><p>Don‚Äôt forget to regularly check our Facebook and Twitter pages, as they are where we post about upcoming meetings and internship opportunities!<br/></p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Heather Schindler</p><p><i>Vice President of Social Media</i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612969323,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZKqciu1yRz1rh","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>Education panel at NYU</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612917560,"NoteCount":134,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1yRyrCu","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>This view never gets old! üòç</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612856318,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZSj_gj1yRycF_","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>Oh man Oman!

It‚Äôs about feeling isolated as a Cambodian American in the United States and navigating one‚Äôs identity, history, and trauma. I draw from my own experiences, having grown up not in Lowell or Long Beach where Cambodian communities are thriving‚Äîbut in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I hope Cambodian Americans read this book to continue the ongoing conversation about our shared history and how it has shaped our experience(s). I also hope my book complicates these discussions, offering a different insight into what it means to be Cambodian American. Year Zero is for anyone interested in processing the history of the killing fields and how it has shaped our lives as children of survivors. </p><!-- more --><p>I wrote this book because growing up, I wasn‚Äôt learning about Cambodia in history class or reading about it in textbooks. Toni Morrison says, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a book that you want to read, but it hasn&rsquo;t been written yet, then you must write it.&rdquo; Year Zero is my response to that. I also want to pass down Toni Morrison‚Äôs words to Cambodian American youths. I‚Äôm encouraging you all to write the book that hasn&rsquo;t been written yet. </p><p>KHMERICAN: How can your book heal Cambodians? </p><p>MONICA SOK: I‚Äôm not sure if my book has the power to heal anybody, but writing it has been healing for me. Throughout my life, I have felt isolated as a Cambodian American, and I know that there are others who share the same experiences‚Äîwhether they have felt out of place in a predominantly white high school or grew up in a small town where there were only two or three other Cambodian families, etc. Writing has helped me make my experience visible to those who treat it as invisible. Year Zero is my way of simply saying to other Cambodian Americans: I see you. Your story is important. You are important. </p><p>Part of this book also struggles to process the history of the killing fields as a personal and public history. A Cambodian might read my poems and say, But why do we need another story about the Khmer Rouge? That‚Äôs been done before. I‚Äôm aware of this. Every Cambodian story is about that. So often the mainstream Cambodian narrative falls to victimhood or recollects the trauma of the killing fields. But like every Cambodian, I can‚Äôt escape the history I have inherited. It will always be a part of my poetry somehow, as the soft music playing on the back porch or the actual room I make my readers stand in. My hope is that Cambodian Americans will see themselves in these pages and will begin to write their own stories to heal.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133505382568,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z3tfbu1yLYdYe","DateString":"2015-11-19","Text":"<p>NYU</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133499359779,"NoteCount":6,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJEAfx1yLBf8Z","DateString":"2015-11-19","Text":"<p>I got my black on black on black. üòù  #wardrobe #gapbody #dance #rehearsal #dancer #nyu #tischschoolofthearts #redhead</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133494558237,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZV54fr1yKvKuT","DateString":"2015-11-18","Text":"<p>Unfortunately I don‚Äôt think I have any revolutionary information to share, but the biggest things you should look into when it comes to being able to pay for NYU‚Äôs tuition are scholarships.

I have, however, been reading! I‚Äôm currently 100 pages (this is A LOT for me) into Between The World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates. It‚Äôs definitely been a super hard reading for me with all the literary magic and historical references, but also just the challenge I need right now. With my Facebook being dominated by ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in international politics, institutionalized racism, and white people who refuse to acknowledge that racism is still a thing, this book is a way for me to focus all of my energy on a single narrative. To listen, read, and feel without the ability to form my own opinion or speak against it. I mean, it‚Äôs a published book, right?</p><p>Lately, I‚Äôve also been consumed in my schoolwork. I don‚Äôt know about any other STEM students, but isn‚Äôt it weird how emotional and physical stress comes second to academic stress? Maybe I should use some I-statements here: I, Angie, am literally INCAPABLE of managing more than one stress at a time. Two weeks ago, my stress was coming to terms with the homophobia within my family. A week ago, it was coming out to my father, who was notorious for being a racist and homophobe - luckily, things went well. With the support of my girlfriend, my two best friends, and some double chocolate chip pancakes at iHop to celebrate, that night of coming out was a lot easier than I have ever imagined.¬†</p><p>-Pause: in case if anyone is late, I‚Äôm hellllla queer in all the ways (gender &amp; sexuality). At this time, I came out to my dad as¬†‚Äúgay,‚Äù because I‚Äôm not even going to try to get into conversation about other genders outside the gender binary.-</p><p>I told the rest of my family and my therapist about coming out to my biological father - and they were all proud and supportive. But part of me still feels empty. Sure, I‚Äôm out to the ‚Äúworld,‚Äù essentially. But I can‚Äôt help but feel that I‚Äôm being forced back into the closet.</p><p>What makes me feel this way, you may ask. It‚Äôs the way my family won‚Äôt say¬†‚Äúgay,‚Äù louder than a hushed tone. The way I‚Äôve been told to keep my relationships on the DL. It‚Äôs the way that my girlfriend (or any of my past female partners) have been referred to as my,¬†‚Äúfriend,‚Äù rather than as my partners, girlfriends, hook ups, etc. I‚Äôm tired of my identity being erased - this spans across my family and to other contexts. And there are times where I do¬†‚Äúcensor‚Äù it myself, by using language such as¬†‚Äúbae,‚Äù or¬†‚Äúpartner.‚Äù Part of me feels a little crappy about it, but I know it‚Äôs for survival - to put it in a real way. Sometimes I don‚Äôt feel safe or comfortable coming out to people, especially being at an engineering school. NYU Tandon has not proved itself to be LGBTQ friendly (or even women-friendly, tbh) just yet, considering¬†‚Äúgay‚Äù is still thrown around as an insult and men are still doing stuff¬†‚Äúlike a girl.‚Äù¬†</p><p>I‚Äôve got to go study for MATLAB, but I‚Äôve had the sudden urge to write a blog post tonight!</p><p><br/></p><p>This is all I‚Äôve got for now!

Especially since she raised well over $140,000, and with all of my non-profit jobs, the fine print on the page mentioned that she would be donating copies to not-for-profit organizations! *win* So long story short, I sent an email detailing my many classes and how the demographics that she is focusing on are exactly my students and their families. So The Universe worked in our favor, and a few months later, after paying just for shipping, a small, but heavy box arrives to my door crammed full of 20 of these amazing books! A few months following that box, I received an email stating that I was selected for ANOTHER FREE BOX of books!!!!!!!!!! The families were oh so grateful to receive the books!!!

I could not miss such an opportunity to finally meet Leanne to remind her [as I am sure everyone says it, including the Washington Post] how great of a resource this is for nonprofit organizations and their clients, who can purchase this book at a discounted rate. Best part of the night, was chatting with her to find out that next she is considering a children‚Äôs book, and that she remembered my name [how many Shaymar‚Äôs could there be, right]!

Why am I so bad at ironing? ¬†</b><a href=\"http://jonesrooy-shanghai.tumblr.com/post/132158364118/10-things-ive-learned-from-filming-myself\" target=\"_blank\">I now iron every morning</a> and still look like a mess on camera. ¬†Maybe the camera adds &hellip; wrinkles. ¬†Best not to think about it.</p><p><b>2. Should I wear my hair down?</b>¬† No, because then it gets in my face. ¬†But if I pull it back I look like a horse. ¬†What about half up? ¬†No, that‚Äôs too¬†‚ÄúTom Cruise in Magnolia.‚Äù ¬†Shit, have I accidentally been filming this whole time? ¬†Sorry, people who have to edit this.</p><p><b>3. What is the point of teaching? </b>¬†In five years of teaching and many more of TA-ing I‚Äôve never thought about this. ¬†Now I think about it all the time. ¬†Having to constrain myself to just four 7-minute videos means I have to be really deliberate about what I am saying to students. ¬†This means choosing between different things, like &ndash; should I be summarizing the readings (they‚Äôre hard)? ¬†Should I be connecting them to each other? ¬†Should I be connecting them to the real world? ¬†Should I be talking about something else and let the readings speak for themselves? ¬†In a normal classroom the answer to all of these questions is a moving target version of ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but now I don‚Äôt have the luxury of 2.5 hours in front of a room to do it all. ¬†So it makes me really, really think hard: What am I trying to say?</p><p>Put another way &ndash; What is the value-added of a teacher? ¬†My students are smart, can‚Äôt they just do the readings and the assignments without my videos, and then if they have questions I could be there to answer them? ¬†If that‚Äôs true, why do we even have universities in the first place?</p><p>My college boyfriend used to say that the point of college was to make you read things that you want to read anyway but would never otherwise get around to. ¬†I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wrong, but so far my best improved answer to this question is &ndash; my job is to make you want to read about all this in the first place.</p><p>Maybe? ¬†I‚Äôm curious to hear what others think about this.</p><p><b>4. Should I coordinate my¬†outfit with my¬†slides?</b> ¬†Yes. ¬†I have become Ms. Frizzle.¬† It¬†turns out, if the color of your clothes is too similar to the slides, it looks like you got sucked into them. ¬†I wore a black dress against black slides one day and it looked like being taught by a floating head (not an altogether bad look once you get used to it). ¬†Other times if your colors are too far off, the light hits either you or the slides weirdly. ¬†I had to put a sweater on once to mute a light shirt that was reflecting weirdly off a dark screen. ¬†Today I think I nailed it, though &ndash; grey slides with navy blue headings, and a navy blue shirt! ¬†Here‚Äôs the secret: you just want matching accents.</p><p><b>5. How do I fold the Jurassic Park theme song into every aspect of my life? ¬†</b>By opening the videos with music! ¬†So far we are going to enjoy a bit of Bach one day, the sound of applause on Standing Ovation day, and, yes indeed, the theme song to the best movie ever on ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù day. ¬†The irony of Professor T-Rex teaching to dinosaur music is not lost on me, and is in fact deliberate.</p><p><b>6. Am I bipolar? ¬†</b>I shot two modules (module = one week of material) this week. ¬†In the first one, I had to do a million takes and would lie on the floor in between them for half an hour at a time. ¬†Today I did each of the four parts in almost one take and was jumping out of the screen constantly with excitement. ¬†Students, when you watch Modules 4 and 5 please diagnose me.</p><p><b>7. Should I do another take?</b> ¬†Maybe not? ¬†An open question we are dealing with is whether to aim for a perfect/polished set of videos, or videos that are more the¬†‚Äúreal life‚Äù (meaning mistake-filled) Andrea Jones-Rooy¬†experience. ¬†This is a real dilemma. ¬†Since these are being preserved for all eternity (obviously), the temptation every time I stumble over a word is to stop the tape and redo it. ¬†But I‚Äôve been watching a lot of Khan academy videos and <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/lecture/IdA4x/the-standing-ovation-model\" target=\"_blank\">videos of my advisor</a>, the great Scott E. Page, on Coursera, and there‚Äôs something about them seeming¬†‚Äúreal‚Äù that is appealing. ¬†I don‚Äôt know yet which is better. ¬†N.b. I almost knocked over the screen one day while filming and then was like¬†‚ÄúKEEP THAT IT‚ÄôS PERFECT FOR ENTROPY.‚Äù</p><p><b>8. Is this a good idea at all?</b>¬† Some days I think this is going to be the best thing ever. ¬†Other days I think, how can anyone ever learn from this shit? ¬†How am I going to monitor online participation? ¬†What‚Äôs going to keep people interested in a bunch videos? ¬†How am I going to handle not talking in person with my students about these really hard concepts?</p><p><b>9. Why am I doing this? ¬†</b>This process is fucking hard. ¬†I almost never sleep, I have no social life, and I‚Äôm in the thick of it all so it‚Äôs not like I can just stop. ¬†Sure, it‚Äôs only¬†four 7-minute videos, but that means preparing all new material (not only is it a¬†brand new course for me, but I‚Äôve also never even taught in this field before) like I would for an in-person class, THEN figuring out how to distill it into 4 short movies, THEN filming it, which so far has never taken less than 2 hours (today was the fastest), THEN coming home and preparing for my real class, then after that preparing for this all over again. ¬†And I still don‚Äôt know how we are going to actually run the damn course.</p><p><b>10. How could I have forgotten how much I love complexity?</b>¬† Rediscovering complexity has been the real joy of all of this. ¬†Filming and everything is also really fun, but my goodness did I forget how this subject makes my heart beat faster. ¬†Either that or it‚Äôs all the coffee.</p><p>And now, I‚Äôm off to perform standup for a room with PEOPLE in it &ndash; won‚Äôt that be weird! ¬†See you next time, students, friends, dinosaurs!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/ae48cdde1c7e6b8ab9ec5f8d69741046/tumblr_inline_nxe5abdDIe1qzy3cw_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\"/></figure><p><b>Fig. 1. ¬†Professor T-Rex enjoys some coffee, modesty.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"950\" data-orig-height=\"596\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/4a6f860044995a5a5c6b5db4c8d8ec2b/tumblr_inline_nxe5arppbn1qzy3cw_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"950\" data-orig-height=\"596\"/></figure><p><b>Fig. 2. ¬†I‚Äôm definitely bipolar.</b></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132651655295,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZBz40y1xYfw1-","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>#timeflies #aliceinwonderland #nyc #nyu</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132641649026,"NoteCount":12,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZGSkMy1xY3l62","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132637526619,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZNuH7j1xXq0fR","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>Free time at NYU #washingtonsquarepark #nyu #autumndays #nyc (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132634315661,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZRs-7y1xXdmkD","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>Screening of my friend @be__squared &rsquo;s senior thesis film, &ldquo;Blood and Water&rdquo;.

We asked him for his input on how to overcome reservations or fears before participating in large, public events. After all, it requires initiative and courage to take on a heated issue and high-profile opponent! He believes that the best antidote for nerves is careful preparation and practice, saying, ‚ÄúI overcame any concerns by practicing my speeches and getting feedback from my friends and teammates.‚Äù He cautions that this does not make him fearless, encouraging students who may be too nervous to take that first step that, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about never being nervous, but rather acknowledging that uncertainty and going forward anyway.‚Äù</p><p>Wenbo also shared how his definition and practice of leadership have been shaped by many people, explaining that ‚Äúprofessors, coaches, and friends have all been a big part of my life; I would not be where I am without their advice and mentorship. Their experience and feedback have shaped me to be more critical in my argumentation and a much better orator.‚Äù</p><p>These experiences contributed to Wenbo&rsquo;s desire to ‚Äú have an intellectual dialogue with both President Sexton and the audience to challenge the notions that have been taken for granted for far too long.‚Äù For Wenbo, the value of the debate was less about personal ideology and instead about ‚Äúconfronting ideas largely not challenged, [and getting] people to expand their understanding on the subject.‚Äù This sentiment was echoed by President Sexton who pointed out that the final vote (50-24, in his favor) was inconsequential compared to the value of the dialogue and discussion.<br/></p><p>In the spirit of truly inclusive leadership, the real winners of the debate were all the students, faculty, and community members who engaged with a diverse array of perspectives on an issue that plays a such critical role in people&rsquo;s lives. </p><p>Thank you, Wenbo, for sharing your reflections with us, and we can‚Äôt wait to see what you are up to next!<br/></p><p>For anyone interested in nominating an individual, pair or group of students to be featured in our #NYULeaders series, simply email <a href=\"mailto:leadershipinitiative@nyu.edu\">leadershipinitiative@nyu.edu</a> with a name and email as well as two to three sentences about how your nominee(s) is practicing ethical, collaborative, and inclusive leadership! </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132539126127,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZO8XBl1xRyf5l","DateString":"2015-11-04","Text":"<figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/8771bf5ea0860208697307b6bf43c37a/tumblr_inline_nxaq23vDGy1tpnpgl_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/></figure><p>Please check the link below from the Graduate Center events calendar.

It asks why different kinds of legal systems developed\nin different parts of the world at different times. What brings about legal\nchange? ¬†What does law do? How is it\nadministered? How has law been used to sustain social inequality, and to\nchallenge inequality. What new legal problems arise when attempts are made to\nuse law as an instrument of social chanag? In our discussion of law and\ninequality we will be giving particular attention to inequalities associated with social class,\nrace, sex and sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n<b>2) What is one book or article you will discuss in class? ¬†</b><br/></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne\nbook we will be discussing is John Sutton‚Äôs Law/Society: Origins,\nInteractions and Change.<br/></p><p><b>\n\n3) How is this course structured?\n\n<br/></b></p><p>This interdisciplinary course\ncontains both lectures and discussion. It draws on theory and research in\nsociology, anthropology, history, political science, philosophy, economics and\njurisprudence. There will be no exams. \nDuring the semester, students will write four short papers.</p><p><b>\n\n4) How can a non-Sociology major benefit from this course?\n\n</b><br/></p><p>Non-majors will gain a better\nunderstanding of an extremely important part of contemporary societies (as will\nmajors). Although the course is in no way a preview of a law school course, it\nwill offer students considering going to law school an exposure to alternative\nperspectives on law developed in the social sciences. </p><p>Learn more about Professor David Greenberg <a href=\"http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/object/davidgreenberg.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3888\" data-orig-height=\"2916\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/981f788f8cb19ee88d16b973949488b2/tumblr_inline_nx1exck5JU1tq86mg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3888\" data-orig-height=\"2916\"/></figure>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132218460483,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZrCISo1x8rPb3","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132215661679,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZDIpJt1x8gkHl","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":"<figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"humor-trash:eEnZk9YMmm3Kmb-JYifSew:Zyh2kp1vJzHEb\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/befb07f908146a78847d2533b2066a4d/tumblr_nvj74oh9X21t2e874o1_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>Happy Halloween NYU!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132214496503,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZiU6_p1x8cHpt","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":"<p>Final version of #WynnieAsASuperhero, by Aton: @i_aton!

But Liv asked me to come with, and when she bats her eyelashes and gets that look on her face, I am compelled as if by some magical force, and have to do whatever my fianc√©e wants Even if it‚Äôs completely crazy.<br/>\tLiv, frankly, doesn‚Äôt do things like his much either, but she had been trying for a long time to make friends at the hospital, so when Marcie, her ex-nemesis coworker asked her, she felt like she had to go. <br/>\tAt first, I was going let her go by herself, because if Marcie hated Liv, she hated me even more, just for existing and having large biceps. But like I said, neither of us really does that kind of thing. So she figured it would be good if she had me in her corner. And frankly, I‚Äôd had the kind of shit day at the children‚Äôs shelter that can only be mitigated by alcohol, shoot-em-up video games, or both. <br/>\tWe had no clue what we were getting into.<br/>\tAt first, everything was fine. ¬†I mean, sure, the number of people who were high off their asses was out of my comfort zone, but we had a couple drinks, met some of Marcie‚Äôs friends, and, as it turned out, maybe Drunk Marcie didn‚Äôt hate us quite as much as Sober Marcie. And maybe she was kind of fun to hang out with? Kind of?<br/>\tAnyway, it turned out that the whole boat party was put together by this gross energy drink company called Max Rager, and they were handing out free samples to everyone they could get their scantily-clad salesgirls close to. We avoided them. And the drug dealers. We danced, we had a good time. Marcie, on the other hand, got high as shit on some new, dangerous stuff called utopium and mixed it with the godawful energy drink. She was gone.<br/>\tAt first, she was telling me and Liv all about how adorable we were, and how wrong it was that we were so goddamn perfect or something. (Which is ridiculous, first off nobody‚Äôs perfect, and second, we‚Äôre both self-sacrificing exercise-nut workaholics with no time for each other, let alone ‚Äúperfect lives‚Äù. Or, well, I guess we were.) <br/>\tBut then, she got this crazy look in her eyes, and went basically nonverbal except for the occasional murmur about how high she was and how good this shit was. We were about to take her home and get the fuck off that boat when the party turned into an actual scene from a zombie movie. <br/>\tThat is not an exaggeration. <br/>\tWhile we were trying to pull her away from the boat, Marcie bit me on the arm. Hard. And while I was still trying to process what had just happened, she went for Liv. I tried to stop her, but before I knew it, there were, like, twenty different people trying to kill us and just about everyone else on the boat. We pushed and shoved and tried to get to the side, screaming and trying to hold onto each other for dear life. <br/>\tI‚Äôm not really sure what happened after that. I woke up in a body bag on the beach, feeling like a bug holding onto its last bits of life after a shoe fell on top of it. That is not a situation I relish being in ever again. Oh, and did I mention the sudden onset of a serious craving for fresh, hot, human brains straight from the skull? Because that‚Äôs a thing that happened.<br/>\tI ripped open the body bag, and quickly discovered that being a zombie also means having the senses of a mentally impaired rhinoceros. Color vision was kinda there, but my nose seemed to have just plain stopped working, and my whole body seemed to be mildly numb. But none of that mattered. Because nothing was more important than brains brains brains brains brains. <br/>\tBut that was before I saw Liv. She had spontaneously developed a white streak in her long brown hair, was angry-Goth-kid pale, and was running away from the beach as fast as she possibly could. <br/>\tAnd running away from me too. I rushed after her, stumbling over a beach full of body bags and horrified paramedics. She had just reached the forest when I got up, but in my hunger-haze I was just lucid enough to yell out, ‚ÄúLiv! Hey! Liv, it‚Äôs Major! Wait up!‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúMajor! Oh my God! Major, you made it! You‚Äôre here! I thought you were dead‚Ä¶‚Äù Then I caught up to her‚Ä¶and she visibly recoiled.<br/>\t‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶did what happened to me‚Ä¶did it also happen to you? Are you weirdly hungry too? Major, what the fuck is going on here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, Liv. I have no clue. But at least we can figure it out together.‚Äù<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132096995714,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn1x1c362","DateString":"2015-10-28","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/230343222&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>On a special edition of Weekend Events, <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/rachel-ag-gilman\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel A.G.

If you‚Äôre looking for a quiet study spot, try one of the north rooms on any of the even-numbered floors or any wing on any floor, really. It is a library after all&hellip;</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"441\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/2788a41984ed6649ba3ed8a11be0ac6c/tumblr_inline_nv502983581ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"435\"/></figure><p>But sometimes you need to do more than independent study, and there‚Äôs space for that too! If you‚Äôre looking to talk or meet with a group, go to Fifth Floor South, or book a¬†<a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/services/group_study.html\">study room.</a></p>\n\n<p>¬†Some other areas you might want to hit:</p>\n<ul><li><b>Periodicals (Third Floor East):¬†</b>This room has a ton of interesting periodicals from all over the world. From Sports Illustrated to The Economist, come here to relax for a bit and read. ¬†<br/></li>\n\n<li><b>Avery Fischer Center (Second Floor):</b> On the second floor, there are a bunch of DVDs and movies that you can watch. You can also import thousands of CD‚Äôs to your iTunes/music library! It‚Äôs unfortunately same-day return, but there are lots of eclectic old movies and desks where you can study in silence.<br/></li><li><b>New School Library, Cooper Union Library, Columbia Library, etc:</b> In addition to granting you access to Bobst, NYU has a consortium <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/about/columbia.html\">with</a> <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/about/locations.html#consortium\">tons</a> of libraries <a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/partners.html\">across the country</a> where you can get a guest pass.

Your NYU Card also grants you access to thousands of amazing research databases that are excellent for any essay.

Pro Tip:¬†<b>Make sure it says ‚Äúon shelf;‚Äù¬†</b>when it says ‚Äúavailable‚Äù it isn‚Äôt always¬†<a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/bobcat/availability.html\"><i>really</i>¬†available .</a><br/></li><li>The books are sorted alphabetically by call number. There‚Äôs a directory at each elevator bank you can reference.<br/></li><li>If the book isn‚Äôt there, make sure to check the shelving room (on any floor above three), which is always in the southeast corner.<br/></li><li>If it isn‚Äôt there either, talk to a staff member who may have just received it. (Or the book could be stolen&hellip; Either way, talk to a staff member.)<br/></li></ol><br/><h2>Course Reserves</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"571\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/642531840b11d532e95f2d6c7dd0f26e/tumblr_inline_nw4dvlovBx1ro0zrp_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"571\"/></figure><p>Many professors are generous and place books or articles for class at Course Reserves. These books come with certain privileges and can‚Äôt be found in the main stacks. Here‚Äôs how to use them:</p><ol><li>Make sure to have the call number in advance. You can find this on the library home<a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/\">¬†page</a> by searching under the¬†‚ÄòCourse Reserves‚Äô tab.¬†</li><li>Go to the main desk on the first floor (the desk used to be on LL2, but they moved!)</li><li>The book is yours for two hours, or if you check them out within two hours of reserves closing, they are due the next morning when they open.</li></ol><p>Fun fact: This is also where you get markers for whiteboards in study rooms! They‚Äôre due back by the end of the day.</p>\n<br/><h2><b>Leaving Bobst</b></h2>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"211\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/75e8c676ebcfade55e23f14f7bde3750/tumblr_inline_nv4zwzdmtC1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"635\"/></figure><p>Yes, exiting Bobst can be surprisingly more complicated than opening a door&hellip; When you leave, make sure that your books (even ones you checked out!) are handed to the person at the exit desk.

It‚Äôs kinda a secret or something&hellip;</p><p>Remember: If all else fails, ask a librarian!¬†<a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/ask/\">You can email, IM, even text them for help if you need it</a>.

Last Thursday, I was in the darkroom for more than 4 hours. Most of the day before was spent gaining a deeper understanding of C and Assembly. A significant amount of time this weekend was devoted to writing a specialized data structure in Java. While I like the fact that my schedule is flexible enough for me to do this, I&rsquo;ve found that breaking things into smaller chunks really helps. It let&rsquo;s your mind recover from intensive thinking on one subject while still being productive. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m taking a break from studying Algorithms to write another update post. Today&rsquo;s topic is music. Specifically percussion. Specifically my experience with percussion at NYU.\n<!-- more -->\nMy perception of the percussion scene here is influenced mainly by the ensembles that I am a part of, NYU Community Orchestra and NYU Rhythmic Impulse (NYURI). I also know that NYU Steinhardt has quite the percussion performance program, with a great percussion ensemble and headquarters called the <em>Percussion Penthouse</em>. Unfortunately, the ensemble and Penthouse are exclusive to students in the percussion program. I was extremely disappointed to hear this, but in the grand scheme of things, it is (very, very) understandable.\nHere&rsquo;s an unorganized list of what I&rsquo;ve learned through these two groups:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>The relatively low intensity of Community Orchestra is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great only having one rehearsal a week. But on the other, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to come late because there&rsquo;s no penalty for doing so.</p></li>\n<li><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten <strong>very</strong> rusty. But that&rsquo;s not all. I think I&rsquo;ve also lost some confidence. Back when I was in high school and regularly practicing, hard passages wouldn&rsquo;t really phase me. I&rsquo;d face them head on and do my best. If it didn&rsquo;t work out, so what? I&rsquo;d simply try again. Now, I get caught up. I&rsquo;m actively working on getting to where I used to be. It&rsquo;ll be hard, but I feel that I can do it.</p></li>\n<li><p>NYURI is NYU&rsquo;s tradition Korean drumming ensemble. While I have dabbled in world percussion before, Korean drumming is totally new for me. I&rsquo;m playing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggu\">Janggu</a>. It&rsquo;s really awesome getting back to the basics and learning a new instrument.</p></li>\n<li><p>Like a lot of other traditional percussion cultures, Korean drumming isn&rsquo;t written down. The beats and rhythms are simply taught by ear or example. I have found however, that there&rsquo;s an enjoyable amount of 3-over-2&rsquo;s and 4-over-3&rsquo;s in this tradition.</p></li>\n<li><p>I&rsquo;m glad I joined NYURI. The ensemble is surprisingly social compared to other student clubs. After each rehearsal, the members go out to dinner and hangout for the rest of the night. People always say that it&rsquo;s hard making friends at NYU. This is true to some extent, but through this group, it was a breeze.</p></li>\n</ul><p>That&rsquo;s all I have for now. I&rsquo;m feeling one or two more update posts in the near future. Most likely in about a week, when my remaining midterm tests and projects are completed.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131920633360,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zjbc6q1wt5HuG","DateString":"2015-10-26","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131919375531,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zso-2y1wt0Uoh","DateString":"2015-10-26","Text":"<p>Let&rsquo;s just say me and my roommates are lit. </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131917482518,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZO6X8l1wsvGeM","DateString":"2015-10-26","Text":"<p>I tried</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131909533477,"NoteCount":17,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZgEVNp1wsQxyb","DateString":"2015-10-25","Text":"<p>Thank you <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mTzLPw5zhg2nuARVfpxX3yw\" target=\"_blank\">@causeyouaremystar</a> for tagging me in ‚ÄúMy Aesthetic Using Pictures From My Phone‚Äù!!! ^_^ I‚Äôd like to tag: <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mEKsrBMCPhZkSJj-V5081hA\" target=\"_blank\">@sunshinensaltwater</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mRwSpOdbNxP_H-1KtsVCYgw\" target=\"_blank\">@sunshinennsaltwater</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mWpOq3TCW4X0DMuWAWgtRMQ\" target=\"_blank\">@dantheblogger</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/m-yqmjAyFa-8UVHHFLoEmcA\" target=\"_blank\">@busrablogs</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/m-d9JKnxfPAHJp2xkz9vCpg\" target=\"_blank\">@itsmrsshankly</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mPFGZOqnX1kKZD6ap-8CzxA\" target=\"_blank\">@pokeiwin</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mFAfTrewq6sMn4U_F0F-Xkw\" target=\"_blank\">@sexydeatheater</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/maGL-yd5OxqxkQHTh1vQx-g\" target=\"_blank\">@donghyuun</a> <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/m6J6D7619SMl58bReU3O4LA\" target=\"_blank\">@faye-garvin</a> and anyone else who wants to do this!!! ^_^</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131908715713,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1wsNqJ1","DateString":"2015-10-25","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131905829633,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZSj_gj1wsCpi1","DateString":"2015-10-25","Text":"<p>It&rsquo;s been real, Sri Lanka.

Every Sunday, all-semester-long, students are allowed free reign inside every foodie‚Äôs paradise (for a measly meal swipe). What sorts of wonders might one find within the walls of this dining hall? Too many to count, honestly, but here are some of the finest of them all:</p><p><small><i>(And, yes, all the GIFs depict actual, mouth-watering food found at Palladium.)</i></small><br/><b><br/></b></p><h2>Chocolate Fountain</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/7f61f047a21c45f60c418d82ff95bb60/tumblr_inline_nwf97mHdpB1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Arguably the crown jewel of Palladium Brunch, the rich milk chocolate fountain is accompanied by fruit, pretzel sticks, and marshmallows. What else do you need, really? (UGH. We‚Äôre already so hungry and this is only the beginning of this post!)<br/></p><!-- more --><h2>Fruit Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/9b6230d563196e76561daf5418b6eb4a/tumblr_inline_nw5yrdEAYr1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>For a healthier option that is nonetheless delicious, Palladium‚Äôs got your back: grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberries are all available by the bowl (and, yes, you can mix and match!). Whipped cream optional, though we highly recommend it.<br/><br/></p><h2>Milkshake Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/c804edefa465162788f3bffbd6d4ba80/tumblr_inline_nw5yr5EydA1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Well, it does <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGL2rytTraA\">bring all the boys to the yard</a>. Palladium‚Äôs shakes come in traditional vanilla, strawberry, or chocolate. Drinking only one is quite a challenge ‚Äî thankfully, we can always come back for more.<br/><br/></p><h2>Eggs Benedict</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/ed656162a62ea13ef25a2275de425955/tumblr_inline_nw5yqveOhc1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Served plain, with salmon, or with Canadian bacon, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one you pick (or how many) because they‚Äôre all amazing. They‚Äôre a nice touch of classic brunch, but in a dining hall filled with all of your friends.<br/><br/></p><h2>Lox and Bagel Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/8c1e16db4dbe9b81d91adee9eb2b838c/tumblr_inline_nw5yqhoGTh1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Yeah, it‚Äôs NYC, you can get a great bagel anywhere. But we‚Äôll bet Palladium beats your local bagel shop when it comes to the fixings. You can get these bad boys with cream cheese, tomato, capers, and some fine salmon, obviously.<br/><br/></p><h2>Dessert Table</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/e09351c75b6a5aaa7b9f1ad8493d6228/tumblr_inline_nw5ypy75Kb1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>With a tableful of mouth-watering eclairs, cannoli, cupcakes, cheesecakes, and many, many more, it‚Äôs hard to control ourselves. Good thing the gym‚Äôs downstairs, right?</p><p>There‚Äôs much more to be enjoyed, of course, which is why Palladium Brunch is famous for being the best of NYU Dining, and why we come back every hungry Sunday morning.

Students must request special access to research in the stacks, located on the third floor of NYU‚Äôs Bobst library. Many of the volumes are old and rare, and everyone‚Äôs so careful with them that you can‚Äôt even bring a pen with you, lest ink bleed onto the pages.</p><p>The Marion Nestle Food Collection is just one small part of the Fales Library, acquired by NYU in 2001 from the private collection of Cecily Brownstone. She was an Associated Press food journalist and friends with James Beard, one of the most famous cookbook authors of the 20th century.</p><p>Everything from cookbooks to nutritional guides finds its home in these stacks. The 12,000-odd volumes from Brownstone are annotated in her own hand, many of them also inscribed by their respective authors. The rest of the books are just as interesting. ‚ÄúAt first I thought these stacks weren‚Äôt all that different from other academic libraries, but as I learned more I started to appreciate how unique it was,‚Äù said Kendall Levison, one student who visited the collection.<br/></p><p>Not least among these robust personalities is the director of the Fales Library, Marvin Taylor.¬†He‚Äôs helped grow the collection into what it is today ‚Äì one of the largest food collections in America. With contributions from Conde Nast, Ladies‚Äô Home Journal, and Caf√© des Artistes, it now spans over 60,000 volumes.<br/></p><p>Taylor is filled with interesting tidbits of trivia about the history of the food collection, as well as the food scene here in New York City. He describes Cecily Brownstone as a¬†‚Äúpiece of work,‚Äù and refers to the surprising number among the cooking community of the 20th century who were queer as the¬†‚Äúgay cooking mafia.‚Äù</p><p>What really stands out is Taylor‚Äôs passion for all this knowledge.¬†‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt really excited about the history behind cookbooks before Marvin started talking about them,‚Äù said Sydney Maynard, another visiting student to the collection.</p><p>And he clearly knows what he‚Äôs talking about: He can name the title of Irma Rombauer‚Äôs biography, ‚ÄúStand Facing the Stove,‚Äù taken from a common line in her book ‚ÄúThe Joy of Cooking.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt seems silly, but this book was first published during the Great Depression,‚Äù explained Taylor. ‚ÄúMiddle-class housewives were cooking their own food for the first time, so even the simplest tasks had to be explained.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt was cool to learn the history of cookbooks and the sociological insight they give,‚Äù said Elana Rubin, another student. Books always say a lot about the people reading them, after all.<br/></p><p>All of this flavorful history helps spice up the initially boring-seeming stacks until there seems to be magic amongst the towering shelves. With books of all shapes, sizes, and colors, the smell of old paper perfuming the air, and Marvin Taylor as your guide, the food collection is an enlightening experience that teaches you how food has divided and brought together people of different times, places, and societies.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131646038488,"NoteCount":8,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z5n2By1wcjo7O","DateString":"2015-10-21","Text":"<p>When I tell people I graduated college at 21, they say,¬†‚ÄúOh, wow.

But with midterms piling on, bundling up in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nyubook.collegestoreonline.com/ePOS?this_category=11&amp;store=209&amp;listtype=begin&amp;form=shared3%2fgm%2fmain%2ehtml&amp;design=209\">NYU sweaters</a> and clutching our hot coffee cups to keep warm is the least of our worries.</p>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1aPvwW4\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/63d5811286fdb6fc92d58319c7bdd8bb/tumblr_inline_nvzewslk911ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Halloween and midterms might fall in the same month, but only one of the two should leave you at your wit‚Äôs end. In any case, we‚Äôve got some tricks and treats to help you get through midterms season painlessly.</p><!-- more -->\n\n<br/><br/><h2>1. Plan your time</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1fSuFJ7\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/b2ddb37348d70775bf458174e0b74861/tumblr_inline_nvzey6Lnh11ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Studying for midterms is pointless if you don‚Äôt know when they are! Buy a planner or even use your phone‚Äôs calendar app to keep all your dates straight. Know when things should be done and finish them by those dates.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Plan out your day hour-by-hour the night before, so no time is ever wasted.</p><br/><h2>2. Figure out what pumps you up and keeps your mood high</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1uqm9ru\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"262\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/faf5cd6881d961383f0263f818188275/tumblr_inline_nvzfahk5Bl1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"262\"/></figure></a><br/><p>If you‚Äôre going to study for a couple hours, you might as well get pumped for it! A happy brain is a productive one, so set yourself up for hours of productivity. Want to go for a walk? Do it! Want to have a dance party? Dance away! Feel like doodling or cooking? Go for it! (Just don&rsquo;t forget to buckle down afterwards.)<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Kill two birds with one stone and head out on a fun <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/130337465766/14-things-to-do-above-14th-street\">adventure above 14th Street</a> or check something off your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/hashtagnyu/nyu-bucket-list/\">NYU Bucket List</a>.</p><br/><h2>3. Organize your tasks</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1OYWtd4\"><figure data-orig-width=\"365\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/249e9ecf9c4baffa08cf805cc147688d/tumblr_inline_nvzezyMTds1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Make lists of all the things you need to do, then break down the big tasks into multiple small tasks so goals seem easily achievable. The more that gets done, the more accomplished you‚Äôll feel (and the better you‚Äôll do)!<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Gain some momentum by including trivial tasks on your to-do list ‚Äî like eating a snack or taking a shower ‚Äî so you have more to cross off.</p><br/><h2>4. Get rest</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/VwHD4i\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/ff70146a025d7b7db1e9600b3d5de255/tumblr_inline_nvzf6nhY6v1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Whether you have midterms or not, you should always be getting a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/98471321896/7-sleep-protips-to-power-you-through-the-semester\">refreshing night of sleep</a>. Pulling an all-nighter to study for that exam might sound like a great idea, BUT IT‚ÄôS NOT. Your body and mind are trying to tell you they‚Äôre at their limit, so don‚Äôt push it! You need that beauty sleep to wake up feeling and looking flawless.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Don‚Äôt hesitate to take a 20 minute nap if you‚Äôre dozing off midday. Naps can be just as important as sleep if you really need it. (Just be sure to set that alarm‚Ä¶ or maybe two?)</p><br/><h2>5. Clean up your workspace</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1S904bU\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/baa25c009fdf654febc9d0996fe51cc6/tumblr_inline_nvzf2nlbMk1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"277\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Feng Shui 101: a cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. Clear out old papers, trash, and any unnecessary things from your desk to maximize your productivity zone. (This includes removing any possible distractions from the area, too.)<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Take time to tidy up not just before you work, but afterwards as well. That way, you can jump right into your next study session without headaches.</p><br/><h2>6. Shake it up</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1JWpgyo\"><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"132\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/65460789a2cb67fa9a104f3d450b4130/tumblr_inline_nvzoxgwvL91ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"269\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Don‚Äôt always study in the same spot. Make things interesting for yourself AND your brain by changing up your test-prep location every once in awhile. Keeping your brain on its toes will keep it fresh for reviewing material.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> We‚Äôve got a starter list of some of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foursquare.com/hashtagnyu/list/places-to-study\">best places on and near campus to buckle down and get to work</a>.</p><br/><h2>7. Work in and out of study groups</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1jj99Q5\"><figure data-orig-width=\"360\" data-orig-height=\"202\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/6f5d1925d89ec2461c30090280d90eef/tumblr_inline_nvzfd0KeUI1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Some people prefer to work in groups. Others prefer to work alone. Decide which works best for you and ‚Äî if you do like study buddies ‚Äî pair up with people who work the same way as you.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Why not get the best of both worlds? Study solo to learn the material on your own, then teach it to your classmate or friend for review (and to share your overflowing knowledge)!</p><br/><h2>8. Listen to music</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1jjCV56\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"268\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/c53d665fdff60eb1fccfd15e07ae7f91/tumblr_inline_nvzp3rKhmN1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"268\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Warning: listening to music isn‚Äôt for everyone! For some people, having the ambient sound is better than silence. For others, the quiet is focusing. Decide which is best for you and stick with it. We‚Äôve got a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/hashtagnyu\">nice range of songs</a>¬†‚Äî from pumped-up playlists to soft music sets ‚Äî to help you on your way.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Love music but find yourself singing along to your jam too often? Listen to film scores or instrumentals instead.</p><br/><h2>9. Take breaks</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1EtV0ae\"><figure data-orig-width=\"325\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/45a160d6e1b6f08d71b1b6a2aa46910b/tumblr_inline_nvzfekQhOI1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"346\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Sure, you‚Äôve got a lot to do. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to work for hours non-stop! Pausing for regular breaks after 25 minutes of focused, hard work will make all the difference in boosting your efficiency and mood.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Briefly review the material you just studied before stepping away for a breather so your hard work doesn‚Äôt walk off with you.</p><br/><h2>10. Keep up your health</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1SiJBlq\"><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"130\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/51839b80c2011d1453727e86a139e7df/tumblr_inline_nvzp8fRjE71ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"265\"/></figure></a><br/><p>You don‚Äôt want to be sniffling and blowing your nose during your exams&hellip; It‚Äôs annoying for you and everyone in class. Plus, stress can seriously influence your overall health. Eat nutritious meals to power your study time with brain food, and always stay hydrated (that means water, not just coffee). Visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/student-health-center.html\">Student Health Center</a> or call the Wellness Exchange (repeat after us: 212-443-9999) if you need to talk something out.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip: </b>Grabbing a bite at an NYU dining hall? Get a fruit to-go and save it for your study sesh later.</p><br/><h2>11. Remain calm</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1b7UtQo\"><figure data-orig-width=\"389\" data-orig-height=\"185\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/78f4afdb1fc244304b851e65983d9bd4/tumblr_inline_nvzpalNy361ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"238\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Midterms will be over before you know it (and finals begin&hellip;). If you‚Äôve followed these tips, worked hard, and tried your best, you have nothing to worry about.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Don‚Äôt forget to treat yo‚Äôself once it‚Äôs all over. You did it! You made it through in one piece. Now go order some Insomnia Cookies and catch up on all those TV episodes you missed.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131163153564,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZxGjlo1w9xkIS","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":"<p>10/13/15 - Jen getting real sassy as usual with her fiesty Latina self during a long overdue catchup Skype! üìûüë≠</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131156740435,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZD5AXy1w9ZGbJ","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131153966264,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn1w9OhIu","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228287222&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nOn this week&rsquo;s episode of <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/weeklyrefresh\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Refresh</a>, <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/keenan-kush\" target=\"_blank\">Keenan</a> and <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/james-russo\" target=\"_blank\">James</a><a></a> are joined by Sergey for the first time since their pilot episode!

But this reminds me of a bigger issue that my school never seems to GET.</p><p>There‚Äôs a great essay by Virginia Woolfe (I‚Äôm not well read, I read this for class once), called¬†‚ÄúA Room of One‚Äôs Own‚Äù, in which Woolfe says women needs opportunities which they don‚Äôt have which is why they don‚Äôt succeed. They don‚Äôt have a room for them just to focus on what they want and think creatively.</p><p>THIS SAME IDEA APPLIES TO COLLEGE STUDENTS.¬†</p><p>When we complain to the administration that we don‚Äôt have this or that, it feels like the administrators don‚Äôt understand the validity of our complaints. Yes, some of it is because we are spoiled privilege rich kids, but on the other hand it‚Äôs because we need to feel comfortable so we are able to focus and study. When there‚Äôs no wifi, we‚Äôre not just mad because we can‚Äôt access social media, we‚Äôre mad because it hinders our studies- especially mine, because I have yet to be at a school with a decent library. I depend on online sources. When you give us alternative places to get internet access, they don‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs not a conducive study environment. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm willing to travel 40 minutes to a student cafe so I can focus more on my work.¬†</p><p>But then they assume we‚Äôre just being lazy people. I‚Äôm sure men thought women were being whiny too for wanting to do more than cooking, and that doesn‚Äôt mean cooking laundry.</p><p>Facilities should be a priority for students. Student well being in general should be more of a focus.</p><p><br/></p><p>The school says that IT will be back on Wednesday to fix our wifi again. Thanks for wasting a week of me being able to quickly check something online in my room, reply to an email from the school, or even fucking skype in comfort and not in a public area. I‚Äôm one of those people who need to feel alone and have it quiet to study. It‚Äôs not just about having wifi, it‚Äôs about the terrible alternatives given.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130950604591,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z82L_p1vzGwSl","DateString":"2015-10-11","Text":"<p>Doodles from the aerobics room</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130946428336,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vz0_sm","DateString":"2015-10-11","Text":"<p>When it comes to Bobst, we love to hate it but can&rsquo;t live without it.

The repeated rhythmic cells wove together nicely, and a cohesive foundation in that regard paved the way for a very clean reading, though one wished occasionally for a bit more intensity, particularly in the strings.</p><p>Halfway through the work, the haze of sound thinned, revealing the timbres of the individual instrumental sections before returning to the sound-world of the first section, but not without allowing the winds, particularly principal flutist DeShaun Gordon King, to shine. Pianist Hakyong Park and the percussion section ended the work on a very cinematic note, the percussion almost inaudible at the last.</p><p><b>Bela Bartok</b>‚Äôs Viola Concerto¬†(1945), along with his Third Piano Concerto, was the last piece he ever worked on; he actually died before finishing his draft of the score, and the concerto was rescued from oblivion by his student and close friend Tibor Serly as well as his commissioner, legendary violist William Primrose. Although alternative editions exist, this one remains the most commonly performed. In three movements, it runs approximately twenty minutes in this edition.</p><p>Violist Fang Han was frankly astonishing; nearly note-for-note perfect, she left the audience stunned. Her sensitivity was particularly appreciated in the pristine, prayerlike opening of the second movement,¬†while her bite was ferocious in the beast that is the third movement. The orchestra suffered from some ensemble issues, particularly in the middle of the cadenza-like passage in the first movement, which features low string and brass interjections between which the viola spits out virtuosic chords and harmonics.¬†</p><p><b>Dmitri Shostakovich</b>‚Äôs Symphony No. 9 in E-Flat Major (1945), unlike other famous Symphony No. 9‚Ä≤s, is a humorous work, full of gaiety and a bit of biting sarcasm, although it reveals a darker side in the fourth movement, a stark <i>Largo</i>.¬†</p><p>There was an interesting observation to be made at the beginning of the first movement; while the individual string sections played very well with themselves, they seemed to have difficulty hooking on rhythmically with each other. Piccolo player Charles Page quickly patched things up, however, with a confident sound that hardly betrayed the difficulty of the writing. The second movement began with clarinets; principal Ki-Deok Park was contemplative and solemn in great contrast to the preceding music. The sonority of the strings was lush and dark with great blend, though the first violins suffered a grave episode of rhythmic confusion in a section solo that seemed to have an eighth note disconnect from the front stand to the last.</p><p>The third movement, a <i>Presto</i> that featured some ricochet action from the first violins, was solidly the highlight of the night in terms of string playing; the strings, perhaps galvanized by the prior movement, were wholly unified and as agile as ever. The brass were somewhat unbalanced, with the trumpets struggling to be heard and the trombones and tuba easily audible. The flutes were again an excellent-sounding section, adding sparkle and flair with their multitude of runs. The end of that movement went <i>attacca</i>¬†into the next, introduced by deep brass tones reminiscent of the Mussorgsky-Ravel <i>Catacombs</i> (from Pictures at an Exhibition) that led into a long recitative for bassoon. Bassoonist Jarrett Grempel filled the hall with an intense, rather bright timbre that tended a bit sharp at times. As he led into the final movement, also an <i>attacca </i>transition, his sound warmed up and intonation stabilized. The <i>Allegretto-Allegro </i>was maneuvered smoothly, lackadaisical and more than a little bit neurotic. The playing was excellent, without hiccups, and an end to the concert that left more than a couple with grins on their faces. ¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130856821781,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlNfuq1vthAGL","DateString":"2015-10-10","Text":"<p>„ÄêÊºîÂá∫Êó•Ë®ò10-09-2015„Äë</p><p><br/></p><p>‰ªäÂ§©ÊºîÂÆå‰∫Ü2015 FallÁöÑÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂ†¥NYUÁÆ°Âº¶Ê®ÇÂúòË°®Êºî„ÄÇ</p><p><br/></p><p>ÈÄôÂ≠∏ÊúüÊÑüË¶∫ÂÅöÂæàÂ§ö‰∫ãÁúüÁöÑÈÉΩÂæóÂøÉÊáâÊâãË®±Â§ö„ÄÇÈÅ©ÊáâÁúüÁöÑÊòØ‰∏Ä‰ª∂ÂæàÈáçË¶ÅÁöÑ‰∫ãÂïäÔºÅÈÇÑË®òÂæó‰ª•ÂâçÂú®ÂúãÂåóÔºåÂ§ß‰∫åÂêπÂ±ïË¶ΩÊúÉ‰πãÁï´ÁöÑÊÖòÁãÄ„ÄÇÂà∞Á¥êÁ¥ÑÂæåÔºåÊüêÊ¨°ÊéíÁ∑¥ÔºåÊàëÁ™ÅÁÑ∂È†ìÊÇü‰∏Ä‰ª∂‰∫ãÔºö‰∏çË´ñ‰Ω†Ë¶∫ÂæóËá™Â∑±ÂêπÂæóÂ•Ω‰∏çÂ•ΩÔºåÂ§ßËÜΩ„ÄÅÊúâËá™‰ø°ÁöÑÂêπÂá∫‰æÜÔºåÁµêÊûúÈÉΩ‰∏çÊúÉÂ∑ÆÂà∞Âì™Âéª„ÄÇÁæéÂúã‰∫∫ÊõøÊàëÈ©óË≠â‰∫ÜÈÄôÂÄã‰æãÂ≠êË®±Â§öÊ¨°„ÄÇË™çË≠òÊàëÁöÑ‰∫∫ÈÉΩÁü•ÈÅìÔºåÊàëÂú®Ë°®ÊºîÁöÑÊôÇÂÄôÂæàÂÆπÊòìÁ∑äÂºµÔºåÊàëÁ∂ìÂ∏∏ÊÄùËÄÉÔºåÊàëÂà∞Â∫ïÊòØ‰∏çÊòØËàûÂè∞ÂûãÁöÑ‰∫∫„ÄÇÂÖ∂ÂØ¶ÊàëÂæàÊÑõÁ´ôÂú®ËàûÂè∞‰∏äÁöÑÊÑüË¶∫Ôºå‰ΩÜÁ∑äÂºµÁ∏ΩÊòØÂ±¢Â±¢Â∞áÊàëÊâìÊïó„ÄÇ<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Êàë‰ª•ÂâçÁúüÁöÑÂæàË®éÂé≠ÂêπÊ®ÇÂúòÁöÑSoloÔºåÊàëÂ∏åÊúõÊàëÂèØ‰ª•Áï∂Á¨¨‰∫åÈÉ®ÔºåÂÅ∂ÁàæÂêπÂêπËã±ÂúãÁÆ°SoloÂ∞±ÂæàÈñãÂøÉ‰∫Ü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂ§©ÊàëÊâìÁ†¥‰∫ÜËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÊ°ÜÊû∂ÔºåÂêπ‰∫Ü‰∏Ä‰∫õSoloÔºåË¶∫ÂæóËá™Â∑±ÈÇÑ‰∏çË≥¥ÔºàÔºüÔºâÊàëÁúüÂøÉÂñúÊ≠°ÂêπÊ®ÇÂúò„ÄÇÂæûÂúã‰∏ÄÊáµÊáÇÁöÑË¢´ÈòøËä±ÊåáÂÆöÁÇ∫È¶ñÂ∏≠ÂæåÔºåËé´ÂêçÁöÑÊúâ‰∏ÄÁ®ÆÁÜ±ÊÉÖÊÉ≥Ë¶Å‰ª•Ê®ÇÂúòÁÇ∫Á¨¨‰∏ÄÁõÆÊ®ôÁöÑËÅ∑Ê•≠„ÄÇÁï∂ÁÑ∂ÊÑàÈï∑Â§ßÊÑàË¶∫ÂæóÈÇÑÊúâÂæàÈï∑ÁöÑË∑ØË¶ÅËµ∞ÔºåÊàëÂú®ËàûÂè∞‰∏äÈÇÑ‰∏çÂ§†Á©©ÂÆöÔºå‰∏çÂ§†ÊúâËÄêÂøÉ„ÄÇ</p><p>ÂÄòËã•Êú™‰æÜÁúüÁöÑÂπ∏ÈÅãÂú∞ÊàêÁÇ∫ÊüêÂÄãËÅ∑Ê•≠Ê®ÇÂúòÁöÑOboistÔºåÊ≠§Ë∫´ÁÑ°ÊÜæÔºÅ</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130841471786,"NoteCount":23,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vsmcig","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>Whether you‚Äôre in NYC or abroad, we ¬†seeing you document the NYU experience with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/instaNYU?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">#<b>instaNYU</b></a>: <a title=\"http://bit.ly/1gKSvsP\" href=\"http://t.co/IpWKCNPoNK\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1gKSvsP </a>¬†<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130838774499,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQh6Ij1vscKBZ","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<blockquote><p>His name is <b>JESSE ST.

He likes to do impromptu singing and dancing and he‚Äôs very unapologetic. Acting like this makes people take a step back from him and even though he knows it‚Äôs a problem he doesn‚Äôt want to change the way he is for anyone. His parents have tried to talk to him about it but it has led to angry arguments and never anything good. He dreams about performing on a big stage someday and have tons of fans adore and love him which is a way of him to cope with feeling so alone. <br/></li><li>He can seem very distant to people but he‚Äôs really just afraid of getting close to anyone, due to being a lonely kid and having trouble making friends all his life. He doesn‚Äôt really know how to act ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in front of others and always seems like he owns the world. His closest friends are those from his childhood that stuck with him and he misses them a lot. He likes to dress casually in darker colors but he still cares about looking good and having a fashionable style. </li><li>Jesse isn‚Äôt the smartest person in the world; in fact he‚Äôs struggling to make it in college at all. He feels like he‚Äôs doing his best but in reality he‚Äôs not. He spends a lot of time practicing his voice instead of doing homework or following up on what is happening in the classes. He can be very lazy when it comes to school but the opposite when it comes to his so called future on Broadway that he can‚Äôt stop dreaming about. He also enjoys taking pictures of the outside and going on long walks to get a good view or scenery. It relaxes him. </li><li>He secretly likes the idea of having a soulmate and the thought of it makes him feel less lonely. He grew up questioning his sexuality as he found himself attracted to both guys and girls but he has never been able to explore these feelings. Both because he‚Äôs too much in love with himself and because his parents doesn‚Äôt like the idea of Jesse being with a guy. He‚Äôs still hiding these feelings and only truly shows who he is to the people he‚Äôs closes to. </li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Jesse has semi-long curly brown hair and with deep blue eyes.

He‚Äôs currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with Sam Evans for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li>The St. James family was a very open and accepting one; they wanted nothing but the best for their boys, but were happy as long as their children were doing something they loved. They offered their support through every situation and had their arms open to any friends or loves that their sons brought into their home. Because of such a loving atmosphere, it wasn‚Äôt incredibly difficult for Peyton to come out to Jesse and his parents when he was fourteen. If anything, Peyton was incredibly thankful because he knew how difficult coming out to your loved one‚Äôs could be for other people. Of his parent‚Äôs, Peyton has always been the closest to his mother - finding his love for the piano through his time spent with her on it‚Äôs bench.<br/></li><li>Because of some heavy asthmatic problems, Peyton refrained from a lot of physical activity through school - opting to join the book club and take piano lessons instead of playing any kind of sports. In a school so big, it was easy to be labelled a nerd or an outcast because of his lack of interest in athletics but because of his kind and witty personality, he had an easy time fitting in with most people in his class. While he loved hanging out with all different kinds of people, he preferred the company of a few close friends over a crowd and spent most of his free time with them at their homes or his own. </li><li>A running joke in the St. James household is the fact that the boys were both given ambiguous names. Their parents chose the names for the kids right after they learned of the pregnancy because they were so overjoyed and couldn‚Äôt wait to be parents. When they went in for the ultrasound to find out the gender of their twins, they were told that they were having girls. The names they‚Äôd chosen, ‚ÄòJesse‚Äô and &lsquo;Peyton‚Äô, fit well and they were happy with their choices. When, to their surprise, two boys were born they decided to stick with what they‚Äôd already chosen instead of choosing something that society would consider a generally male name. </li><li>While most eighteen year olds had no idea what they wanted to do with their future, Peyton had always known that he wanted to play music. He‚Äôd been playing the piano since he was five years old and singing in the high school choir all four years. So, when it came time to send in applications for colleges, Peyton was on top of sending his information to all of the top music schools in the country. While he didn‚Äôt exactly want to leave San Fransisco, his acceptance to NYU couldn‚Äôt be passed up. He‚Äôs incredibly excited to be starting his freshmen year in New York and even though it‚Äôs going to be a very heavy work load studying two majors - Performance Studies through Tisch and Piano Studies at NYU - he knows what he wants for his future and working hard isn‚Äôt going to be a problem for him.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Peyton isn‚Äôt incredibly concerned about what he wears, as long as it‚Äôs comfortable and not overly complicated. He usually keeps his hair short on the sides, longer on top and fairly messy - opting to gel the top if he hasn‚Äôt just rolled out of bed or has to look decent for a performance. He very rarely lets it grow out much longer than his ears. There isn‚Äôt a touch of dye in it, preferring to keep it brown. Eventually he‚Äôd like to have more tattoos, but right now he only has a small treble clef behind his left ear and a small bass clef behind the right. He got them when he turned eighteen in a small act of rebellion. Because it‚Äôs frowned upon for performances, Peyton stays away from a lot of piercings; having just one stud in each ear. Typically, he sticks to plain t-shirts, button ups, flannel and fitted jeans with oxfords or combat boots. Peyton wears contacts primarily, but occasionally wears glasses if he was too lazy to put his contacts in that morning.</div></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130834744871,"NoteCount":4,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vsMyOd","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>Introducing the NYU Tandon School of Engineering‚Äã! <a title=\"http://bit.ly/1LdIAZ7\" href=\"http://t.co/cGkWI9RGc8\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1LdIAZ7 </a>¬†<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130831981719,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vsCPoN","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>(by Sydney Kuo) - Summer in Paris - <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/summer-sessions/summer-abroad/programs.html\"><b><i>Go there</i></b></a><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130830749644,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vs7i-C","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>(by Ryann McQuaid) - Summer in Dublin - <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/summer-sessions/summer-abroad/programs.html\"><i><b>Go there</b></i></a><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130829967914,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vs4k8g","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p><i>‚ÄúTo commemorate my time in Italy/Europe, I created an Instagram inspired \nby Murad Osmann&rsquo;s Instagram (@muradosmann) of his following his \ngirlfriend around the world.

We had run out of funding and knew that we needed to put gas in the tank.\n</p><p>We knew we needed to have a crowdfunding\ncampaign, but we didn‚Äôt want to ask, we were just too nervous. The challenge\nwas: how do we get to a place where we are believing enough in our idea that we\ncan confidently ask our friends,our families, to invest in our project? ?</p><p><b>How did you come to own that fear as part of the\nprocess?</b></p><p>Our brains concoct why this a horrible idea, why\nwe should give up, keep it small, or compromise.

Failure is not a bad\nthing. Failure is the other side of the same coin as success. You can make such\nhuge leaps forward into better thinking and cooler ideas by looking at\nsomething you could have otherwise label as a mistake.</p><p>I think it&rsquo;s important to frame those times in\nterms of a percolation or a gestation.

They brought me and a senior analyst who graduated from NYU in 2012 to mingle with the interviewees in the lobby while they waited for their turn. We were supposed to answer any questions they had about the company, the job, give advice, etc. I wasn‚Äôt actually interviewing anyone, they literally just brought me to spend half the day chatting with nervous af college kids lol.¬†</p><p>But <i>wow</i> it was like deja vu. I can‚Äôt believe I was in their shoes two years ago. I remember when I was a senior, a lot of the companies that came to do OCR also brought recent NYU alumni to network with the interviewees.

I better make a good impression on them too.</i>‚Äù <b>Hahahaha.</b> I actually have pretty much have no say in who is getting invited back for a second round interview. The second round is also the last round, aka our ‚ÄúSuperday.‚Äù That‚Äôs when the company is going to invite all of the students who they liked from yesterday to come to our office and meet with all of the managing directors one by one, then do a case interview, and then take them to dinner (and drinks if they are 21). Also there will be students from other schools like Columbia and Fordham and Baruch, and wherever else we did on-campus interviews. And then after Superday, they will decide who to give job offers to.¬†</p><p>Anyways, it‚Äôs just so interesting being on the other side of things this time. And it makes me SOOOOOOO grateful I am not going through OCR right now lol. I do feel a little awkward helping my company out with recruiting season because of the fact that I‚Äôm simultaneously job-searching for myself under the table.

For starters, as Ken and his amazing grad students corrected me, they aren‚Äôt working on ‚Äúvirtual reality‚Äù, but rather ‚ÄúFuture Reality.‚Äù For them, this four dimensional simulation existence is our best guess at what living in the future will be like.</p>\n<p>So, the only reasonable thing to do was try it out. First off, some volunteers stapped on some equipment, that is to say: anklets, bracelets, and head gear, along with a remote control. Once the Oculus is on, they are no longer standing in the room I‚Äôve pictured below, but a well lit, empty room with wood floors and tall ceilings. Although the two participants can‚Äôt see us, they can see one another (as stick figures of course), and if they want to reach out and grab their what they see of their counterpart‚Äôs hand (in future reality) they can (in actual reality).</p>\n<p>Then, once they are accustomed to their surroundings, the users then can start experimenting with their surroundings. With this magical wand of a remote control, you can draw in three dimensions, and it can be a collaborative effort with the other user together you can draw and build in 3d. You can walk through each others drawings like a ghost, and change the color of your masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Then if that wasn‚Äôt cool enough, you can pull off all your gear and prance on over to the other lab where the Vive is also hooked up to the same simulation, except now you are a giant overlooking those other two schmoes in the other room as they draw and dance and attempt to become accustomed to their new surroundings. The next step in future reality is making it possible for you to make drawings in their world from the other room (and maybe freak them out and play with them a bit, haha). But even if it isn‚Äôt interactive yet, if I believed that I was truly in a different room when I put on the Oculus Rift, the visuals on the Vive are a million times more realistic.</p>\n<p>Once we all went through those simulations, Tom Small from YouTube and Google came to show us his new #360video documentary <a href=\"https://youtu.be/teB-Icrog6E\">‚ÄúKissed by a Wild Mountain Gorilla‚Äù</a> on gorillas in Congo. Not only did we get a chance to look eye to eye with gorillas - to the point where you want to pull the Google Cardboard as far away from you face as possible because you don‚Äôt want to be pulled to shreds by a Silverback - but we also got an inside look at the native peoples who‚Äôs main source of income is the tourism and foreign interest in safari.</p>\n<p>I don‚Äôt know about all these Virtual Reality horror games I keep hearing about, but this was unbelievable! This is what dreams are made of, but actually!</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"960\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

I would address the mailman by name and he‚Äôd ask me how school was going. Whenever I went out for a bagel and a coffee, I could expect the same man to be crouching behind a newspaper at a corner table. His name was Bob and he once asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up.</p><p>Just the other day, my dad texted me:¬†‚ÄúI just ran into Danny from Hang Tai. He asked about you. I told him you were in college and they flipped out.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt recognize the owner of our local Chinese restaurant if I bumped into him on the street, but apparently he knows me.</p><p>It reminds me of the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36034/36034-h/36034-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><i>White Nights</i>¬†by Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the Gardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those I had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year. They, of course, do not know me, but I know them. I know them intimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am delighted when they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud.</p></blockquote><p>There is no such familiarity here. People stand in elevators and do not look at each other. I come to the same spot at the library nearly every day, yet I never encounter the same people. I take the subway at the same time every day I go to work, but the cars are filled with strangers, ear budded and unsmiling.</p><p>My college‚Äôs lack of an actual campus makes it nearly impossible to formulate a sense of community in this overwhelmingly large place. I came here craving anonymity, though I suppose I didn‚Äôt know what it would actually feel like. But it‚Äôs novel and I like it. I like that I can walk down the street on a bad hair day without fearing that I‚Äôll bump into someone I know. I like meeting new and interesting people, even if I don‚Äôt find them in the same spots every day. And maybe, over time, I will become accustomed to meeting the same people, and I will study their faces and interpret their emotions as though they were my nearest friends.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130512982528,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZM6YRj1vZBX80","DateString":"2015-10-05","Text":"<p>This ¬†week was a little different from previous. While last week was a sort of busy one with the arrival of the pope happening, this week was a return to the usual work pace. Sometimes I wonder if the office is a bit over staffed in the Graphics department. Often there&rsquo;s about 6 people in that room including myself and Pratik. Often we&rsquo;ll get a few logos and graphics to make, but usually it seems like most of the work is done by 1pm. Though this rules gets proven otherwise due to how ever-changing a news show can be. The show itself airs at 3 so, any number of things can change til then. Stories might get cut or suddenly added. They might not be pleased with what was done or have a minor suggestion that we&rsquo;ll have to accommodate. This part of the job I like, because it feels fast paced and exciting. Not to say that everything else is boring, because it&rsquo;s anything but that. But, a little surprise alway gets the blood flowing I feel.</p><p>The other interesting thing to take place this week is the loss of my work station. See, the graphics department consists of these computers against the wall which are called work stations. Everyone on the job that day gets a work station and go about their tasks. Simple, right? Now my work station might be what you call a worn out one. The station uses Mac computers, like most graphics teams seem to use today, and mine was a bit of an older model. The programs were dated, and it was somewhat slow. But it worked. Up until last week I got my work done on it so I had no real complaints. This week however, the computer crashed. Which was unfortunate, because most of the work I was doing, was kept locally. ¬†It kind of sucks cause that&rsquo;s quite a bit of time and effort ¬†lost. Not everything I made was for the show, but I suppose that&rsquo;s the risk I took for not having my folder on the network drive.</p><p>Well, with a computer now gone, this meant I was back to working with Pratik at the same computer. It did mean we ended up talking a bit more, but like I said, with work being more stretched out until crunch time, it felt perfectly fine. We still got all of our work done with about two hours to spare. Usually I just use that extra time to check out the news or just pick a project to do to brush up on my skills. It&rsquo;s one of the downsides at working in a ¬†broadcasting station for a news network. You can&rsquo;t really just work on what&rsquo;s coming up. The news isn&rsquo;t planned so carefully because well, it&rsquo;s the news. Something is always happening so we always need to be prepared to adjust and give what&rsquo;s more interesting. Which is more than I can say for the non-stop political coverage of Donald Trump by other news shows.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130501378502,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZnxdMt1vYVG76","DateString":"2015-10-04","Text":"<p><!-- more --></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hc-ronicas.tumblr.com/post/126688216370/telling-a-new-tale\" target=\"_blank\">hc-ronicas</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Telling a New Tale</h2>\n<p>I will be arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 10 (what!?!?) days!

Time feels like it‚Äôs gone by both sooo fast and also so slow at the same time. I feel like i‚Äôve known people for such a long time, even though we‚Äôve only been together for a month. Everything is really getting into full gear now. I had a paper due last week, an exam this week and two papers due next week. It‚Äôs starting to pile up and I have to take a moment to look back at the past month and think about everything that I did:</p><p>Welcome week was absolutely packed. So much happened in such little time. I really got to know about the school and everything that is offered here. There are so many opportunities here, but never enough time to take advantage of all of them. My main extracurricular focus is working for Washington Square News, which staff applications are coming out for pretty soon - so cross your fingers for me!</p><p>My floor has gotten incredibly close. We hang out all the time, and I‚Äôm pretty sure that we know each other more than any other floor. We‚Äôve gone out basically every weekend and explored around the area. We went to see the lunar eclipse at the Brooklyn Bridge together last weekend. I think that it‚Äôs pretty great we have this community on our floor already. It‚Äôs hard to find some solid friends here at NYU, so having that built in community on our exploration floor is really such a relief. I know that even though I might not have a bunch of friends in all my classes, at least I‚Äôll have my floor (which, the people on my floor are better than people in my classes to be honest, sorry).¬†</p><p>Let‚Äôs see, what else has happened over this last month!? Well, I went to two fashion week shows! They were small but it was still a great experience and a fun way to start working for WSN. I went to Tia Cibani and Saga NYC. They were two very different but impressive shows in their own ways. Tia Cibani was this beautiful, very grounded presentation with light and festive designs that I could definitely see myself walking down the street in. Saga NYC was a great take on minimalism and monochromatism in an interactive presentation. I met some great people through it and hopefully it establishes who I am within the WSN community. Staff applications are live, so wish me luck there!</p><p>Technically I‚Äôve been to four concerts now, but one of them was the Global Citizen Festival, which basically counts for like ten different concerts. Coldplay was there. Coldplay performed with Ariana Grande. Tori Kelly was there. Ed Sheeran was there. Ed Sheeran performed with Coldplay. Common performed. Common performed with Sting. Beyonc√© was there. Beyonce and Ed Sheeran sang Drunk in Love together and I think my heart burst. Pearl Jam performed. Beyonce and Eddie Vedder sang Redemption Song. I died a second time. It was probably the most exhausting but best day every. Hugh Jackman and Stephen Colbert hosted the event, Leo DiCaprio was there, Michelle Obama, Bill Nye, Malala, Salma Hayek, the Gates‚Äô, the Bidens, Big Bird, Bono, Queen Reina, Prime Ministers of many countries, UN members and soooo many other people. Best. Day. Ever</p><p>I also went to Walk the Moon with Saint Motel and was super close. That was such a great concert and I love the setting of a show in the park. Central Park is one of my favorite places on the island. The air is so fresh and the sunset was a beautiful backdrop for the start of the show. Both were incredible performers and it was a wonderful night.</p><p>The past couple nights I pulled a concert double header. I went to Stromae on Thursday. He‚Äôs amazing. He is so passionate about his music, he‚Äôs a great dancer and performer and he brings so much heart to his shows. I love his music and it‚Äôs so great to see him reach this incredible achievement of filling up Madison Square Garden. Friday night, I went to the Neighbourhood, Bad Suns and Honey. That was probably one of the most insane concerts I‚Äôve ever been to. The mosh pit was aggressive and kept swaying and I now know what it is like to be a sardine in a can. The Neighbourhood was soooo good live. Jesse pointed at me during the show, and I also nabbed a set list - I was a happy sardine.</p><p>There‚Äôs so much to come soon. I have to go into WSN to work on layout a bit and I have two papers due next week. Everyone is in the midst of midterms, so we can‚Äôt wait to get them over with and celebrate. We‚Äôve got a lot of floor birthdays coming up, so this is going to be a lot of fun!</p><p>More adventures on the way!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130416608027,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZBav1v1vTRuCR","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p>Rainy day blues cure = hookah + surprise bellydancer out at Falucka üíÉüèªüí• you all missed it when she came out with a candelabra on her head #hookah #bellydancer #fun #dance #smoke #chill #rain #nyc #nyu #village #washingtonsquarepark #bleeker (at Falucka Lounge NYC)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130410339721,"NoteCount":6,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZiKHUy1vT3zs9","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p>My Brilliant Friend, Elena Ferrante (F, 50s, Met Museum bag, just starting the book, NYU ISAW lecture)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130406396340,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zsy-yq1vSqx6q","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p><b>WHAT:</b> Dinner with 8 Strangers<br/><b>DATE:</b> Sunday, October 11<br/><b>TIME:</b> 6PM<br/><b>LOCATION:</b> East Village¬†(around 1st Ave &amp; 6th St)</p><!-- more --><p><b>DETAILS:¬†</b>This is an awesome opportunity in which you can enjoy a tasty meal in NYC with other awesome people who live in the Grad Halls (WSV &amp; StuyTown)! ¬†We hope that this will give you an opportunity to meet someone new in a small group setting. ¬†The event will take place at a BYOB Indian restaurant in the East Village and only requires a $5 copay.¬†<b><a href=\"https://orgsync.com/102698/events/1232057/occurrences/2764229\" target=\"_blank\">RSVP Here</a></b>.</p><p>**It is a priority to make our events inclusive and ADA accessible.

He is 18 years old, and originally from <b>BURLINGTON, VERMONT</b>. He‚Äôs currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with _____ for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li> Born as one of two, Blaine Anderson came into the world as a wide eyed, fresh young face, ready to take on the world and all it offered. Or, so he thought, anyways. A young and ambitious child, Blaine considered himself the more driven of his brothers, and as soon as he was able to walk and talk, he put this ambition into overdrive immediately. Blaine was soon singing and dancing all around the house, enjoying a duet with his older brother, Cooper, on more than on occasion. His parents, Sophia and Bruce, were happy beyond all belief to see their children getting along ‚Äî after all, three boys can be quite a handle full, but Blaine didn‚Äôt seem to mind. If he was with his family, then he was happy. <br/></li><li> Being raised in a loving household also helped Blaine believe that his dreams could come true. His mother, Sophia, was born and raised in Sorrento, Italy and she was a main proponent in Blaine‚Äôs confidence, and enthusiasm. His father, Bruce, was a suit and tie business man, though his demeanor was hardly serious. In fact, if anything, his father was the biggest goofball in the house. And when you‚Äôre living under the same roof as Cooper Anderson, that‚Äôs a hard title to beat. With his love of all things Christmas (right down to matching family Christmas sweaters) and off kilter sense of comedy, he and Blaine struck up a close relationship from a young age. Knowing that he had two people to rely on at all times was more than most kids his age could say, and Blaine never took his easy going connection with either one of them for granted. <br/></li><li>As Blaine aged, though, he started to notice differences about himself. While the other boys in middle school were focusing on girls, and how pretty they all seemed to look, Blaine couldn‚Äôt be bothered. Sure, girls were beautiful, and he could admire them from a distance, but he didn‚Äôt feel the need to kiss them, like his friends talked about. In fact, the more he let himself think about it, the more he realized that kissing his friends was more appealing. Boys were.. different, and Blaine admired the way their waists tapered down, and the way their muscles contracted and shifted under their skin. It was confusing, to say the least, and so, as any young boy would, he took to the internet. And, immediately, the internet gave back. Having something to call himself ‚Äì gay ‚Äì was settling, and Blaine felt the pressures of what other people say float off his shoulders with every passing day. At this age, he was still naive enough to think that maybe ‚Äì just maybe ‚Äì it wouldn‚Äôt matter. No one had said anything about it to him, anyways, and Blaine‚Äôs happy-go-lucky personality was a hard thing to target. He officially came out right before high school, during the winter of eighth grade. And while the initial reaction was pretty standard ‚Äì his parents were ever supportive of whatever he wanted to do with his life, and whoever he wanted to love ‚Äì the small bouts of hate began to rear their ugly heads. </li><li>The end of the year brought a Sadie Hawkins dance for the upperclassmen to celebrate their achievements, and Blaine ‚Äì being who he was ‚Äì invited along his friend, Lucas. The two had known each other for years, and Lucas was the only other out person at their school. Going together to show their support just made sense in Blaine‚Äôs mind, and once they were at the dance, Blaine discovered that his fleeting moments of worry were for nothing. It wasn‚Äôt until after the dance, when Blaine and his friend were waiting for their ride to take them home, that his fears became a reality. A hostile group of boys from the high school attacked them both, leaving Blaine and Lucas helpless on the concrete. Immediately, both were taken to the hospital, and after a few months of physical therapy, Blaine was pulled from public school and, instead, enlisted at a private boys boarding school, just an hour outside of their hometown. The isolation was hard, but the no bullying policy was unwavering, and Blaine found himself settling into his new atmosphere (and his new uniform) within the first couple of months. As a freshman, he didn‚Äôt try to approach any of the clubs on campus ‚Äì he needed to keep his grades up in order to remain enrolled in the school, after all ‚Äì but the competitive show choir caught his eye immediately. That passion he had for performing when he was little never diminished, and though his work with local community theaters had been stunted, due to his accident, his love of the arts certainly remained. As a sophomore, Blaine developed the courage to audition, and upon acceptance, finally fell into a group of people he could rely on, and people he felt he could relate to. His junior year, Blaine was put on the council, and during his time in an administrative position, Blaine led his team to two back to back National championships. </li><li>College was lurking around the corner, and Blaine‚Äôs eyes were easily on the best city to be in for people like him ‚Äì New York. NYADA was his first choice, but his time spent off the stage due to his incident cost him a fair chance. So, instead, Blaine found himself at NYU: Tisch, a great alternative for people in the arts. There, he‚Äôs a theater major with a minor in music, and with his passion to succeed and his unwavering spirit, Blaine is sure that he‚Äôll be able to make it to the top one day. He, of course, misses his brother, but he knows how strong Austin is after what he went through, and he‚Äôs positive that they‚Äôll find a way to meet up again in the future, given their natural pull towards a career in music. </li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Blaine‚Äôs style could easily be described as ‚Äòpreppy chic‚Äô. Growing up in a household that wasn‚Äôt exactly strapped for money meant that Blaine could splurge a little on his back to school clothing hauls. He prefers the tight fit of slacks over jeans, though he‚Äôs not against denim in the slightest. He often wears collared shirts, too ‚Äì sleeve length doesn‚Äôt matter. Layering is also something Blaine‚Äôs known to do ‚Äì in the colder months (or even the warmer months), Blaine tends to pair a polo shirt with a matching sweater vest. During the winter, thicker sweaters tend to be Blaine‚Äôs favorite, and though he won‚Äôt admit that he likes labels, Blaine‚Äôs top two choices for clothing stores are Brooks Brothers, and the GAP. His most notable feature is his bowtie ‚Äì Blaine‚Äôs collection is expansive, and maybe borderline out of control. He wears one with every ensemble he pulls together, however, and he tends to match the patterns and colors with as much style as he can. His shoes are almost always Oxfords, though the warmer months tend to put Blaine in boat shoes ‚Äì something he got accustomed to at a young age through the various country club visits he took with his Dad back in Vermont. He‚Äôs also got his Dad‚Äôs old watch on his left wrist at all times.\n\n<p>Physically, Blaine is easy to pick out among a crowd. He‚Äôs shorter than most males, standing at five feet, eight inches tall. His hair ‚Äì while curly in it‚Äôs natural state ‚Äì is always slicked back with a thick sheen of hair gel. When they‚Äôre left unattended to, Blaine swears he can turn people to stone with just a single look. It‚Äôs not very often that Blaine lets anyone see him in such a state. Due to his Italian roots on his mother‚Äôs side, Blaine‚Äôs skin is also easy to tan and color during the summer.</p></div></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130366661659,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQh6Ij1vQTMGR","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<blockquote><p>Her name is <b>OPEN BERRY</b>.

He is 18 years old, and originally from <b>DENVER, COLORADO</b>. He‚Äôs currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with Kennedy Fabray for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li>Sebastian Smythe, and his twin, were born in Paris, France to Xavier and Adelaide Smythe. Their birth was rejoiced, though the novelty quickly wore off and, within weeks, Adelaide was back to her social functions while Xavier immersed himself in his work. Being a lawyer, his services were always in need and his lovely wife was more than willing to reap the benefits, such as top of the line nannies that worked around the clock to provide her children with excellent care. They had a need for nothing as they were given anything that they could possibly dream of having, even as infants.<br/></li><li>At the tender age of 6, Sebastian‚Äôs life was changed. The Smythe family uprooted and made the move to the states where Xavier‚Äôs spectacular skill sets were in much need. With the amount of money they were throwing at the Smythes, how could he think of saying no? Some would say that this was the start of Sebastian‚Äôs entitled ‚Äì and somewhat petulant ‚Äì behavior. Things changed almost drastically. From lavish parties and the city of love just beyond their doorstep to Denver, Colorado ‚Äì middle America where they had no choice but to start over with no friends or family to assist them. Although money was abundant,  their nannies were far more strict, and deemed him undeserving of the treats he demanded, frequently putting up a great fuss until, inevitably, the nanny had no choice but to give him his much desired treat. Rather than discourage his behavior, it was Xavier that encouraged Sebastian to fight for what he wanted and to never take no for an answer. He wouldn‚Äôt know the impact that this lesson would have on Sebastian in later years.</li><li>No one could deny that Sebastian had a charismatic nature that drew people towards him and am innate ability to talk himself in (and out) of any situation. It was the one thing that made him so popular in school. Whether you loved him or hated him, you simply couldn‚Äôt stay away, and Sebastian reveled in all of the attention. Why shouldn‚Äôt he? After all, he fought for his social standing in school ‚Äì with his straight A‚Äôs and ability to stand up to any who dared to see him as weak. And though he had money, it was something that he knew not to take for granted. His father taught him better than that. He could learn to survive without it, though he couldn‚Äôt deny himself the pleasure of indulging his own whims and spoiling himself as only a Smythe knew how.</li><li>Sebastian‚Äôs future had been planned out from the moment that he discovered his love of debate. There were no questions about what it was that he‚Äôd like to do when he could follow tradition. Sebastian was expected to follow in his father‚Äôs footsteps and he was fine with that. He looked up to Xavier and was more than pleased to one day be as respected and beloved as his father was among his friends and colleagues. All it took was one day, one moment, for Sebastian to begin questioning it all. ‚Äì Sebastian‚Äôs sexuality had never been a topic of conversation among the Smythe family. There was no need with Sebastian showing up to events and parties with pretty girls hanging off his arm. Yet there was a part of himself that he was hiding. One which was discovered when his father walked in to find him in a half-dressed state with another boy. The conflicts that would arise from that moment would cause a sense of uncertainty to rise within Sebastian. Was his father really the type of man that he wanted to emulate when he was so quick to turn his back on his own child when faced with Sebastian‚Äôs bisexuality; just because it was something he didn‚Äôt entirely understand or accept?</li><li>It all came to a head when graduation neared and Xavier could no longer keep quiet his views of his son‚Äôs behavior. An ultimatum was made: if Sebastian were to forget about his little ‚Äòexperiment‚Äô with other boys and no longer shame the Smythe name with his ‚Äòdespicable‚Äô acts then Xavier would continue to fund not only Sebastian‚Äôs schooling, but would provide him with a hefty sum to keep him, and his future family comfortable. If not then Sebastian could consider himself cut off and disowned. Xavier would ‚Äúnot tolerate a son who chooses to be gay.‚Äù It didn‚Äôt take Sebastian long to make a decision. Xavier taught him to stand up for himself and that‚Äôs what he decided to do when he turned down his father‚Äôs money and chose to go to NYU, a city far from home where he could live his life, and find his true calling, whatever it may be. With the help of his mother, he found a way to pay his tuition, though Adelaide could hardly afford to anger her husband further by providing Sebastian with little more than some spare cash for books, leaving him in desperate need of money by the time classes were well underway.</li><li>The experiment was not something that Sebastian would have considered, under normal circumstances. He had no desire to involve himself with any one person in particular, especially one who would not be within a short driving distance. Yet it was the money, above all else, that made it difficult for him to say no. It‚Äôs no secret that he thinks that there‚Äôs no such thing as a soulmate but he‚Äôd rather grin and bare it than have to spend his time working meaningless jobs, surrounded by incompetency and stupidity for some extra cash.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Standing at 6 foot, Sebastian has short, brown hair, with a classic gelled upward style, and hazel-blue eyes, which can appear a light shade of green in the right setting. He has a preference for fashion over comfort, often choosing slacks over casual denim, although he isn‚Äôt opposed to dressing down. Due to his desire to be successful like his father, likely in the law field, he has avoided any body modifications such as piercings and tattoos, as it is typically frowned upon.</div></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130363693680,"NoteCount":7,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vQI1fm","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>30 is the new 60!

At the end of the Faith Zone Training, every participant leaves feeling as though they can make a difference in their own community using the things they learned. Here are our Top Ten Tips for Multifaith Work that we recommend every student uses when taking their Faith Zone Training to the real world.¬†</p><p>1. Check out our Principles of Multifaith\nEngagement:</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† i.Reflect diversity, accounting for the complex\nand intersectional identities of our constituents.</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ii. Rooted in fact-to-face encounters and deep\nrelationship-building within and between communities and/or individuals.</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† iii. Committed to social transformation and civic\nengagement (i.e. multifaith issue-based solutions to social problems such as\npoverty, prison industrial complex, human trafficking).</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† iv. Focused on introspection and meaning-making as a\nway of understanding spirituality.</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† v. Inclusive of and attentive to personal\nnarratives through intentional storytelling pedagogy, not just representative\nof religious creed.</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† vi. Supportive of Integration of the whole student\nexperience throughout their academic and co-curricular development. </p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† vii. Supportive of coursework that promotes\nmultifaith leadership.</p><p>2. Create a safe space that encourages dialogue.\nApproach every conversation with a co-learner orientation.</p><p>3. Ask people about their personal practices. Not\nall people within a religious or spiritual community practice in the same way. </p><p>4. Don‚Äôt be afraid of making mistakes. Let those\naround you know that they can voice a concern if something you say offends\nthem. </p><p>5. Whenever possible, organizers should reflect the\ndiversity of those who will be participating in a particular event.</p><p>6. Events should be easily accessible and\ncomfortable for all potential participants. Some things to consider:</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† i. Religious Holidays (available on Google\nCalendar)</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ii. Prayer times</p><p>7. At an event itself, ensure that the structure of\nthe event is inclusive. Some things to consider:</p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† i. Dietary needs such as Kosher, Halal, vegetarian,\nvegan etc. </p><p>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ii. Physical contact between genders</p><p>8. Create an environment where people feel safe\nmaking requests for religious and spiritual observance or practice. Make it\nclear that there will not be ramifications for making that request.</p><p>9. Use inclusive language to welcome students who\ndo not identify with a particular faith tradition or identify as atheist or\nagnostic.</p><p>10. Seek\nhelp or advice from Chaplains and GSL.</p><p>If you have any questions, please contact Ariel Ennis at ariel.ennis@nyu.edu.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130346880690,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zsy-yq1vPHuwo","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130346666764,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZoE7Nm1vPH4iC","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>\n\n<b>Over the following week, as part of the first #NYULeadershipWeek, we will be featuring NYU students and alumni as they reflect on leadership: ¬†</b>¬†</p><p>Helping others near and far through acts small and large can\noften create ripples much greater than expected.

It is the skill of knowing how to bring out the best in others and\nmotivating many to work towards a communal goal. For me, leadership is¬†</i><i>about coordination: piecing together the\ndifferent components and talents available so that the¬†</i><i>sum is greater than its parts. Great leaders, in\nmy view, are those individuals with the ability to¬†</i><i>admit their vulnerabilities and learn from those\nsurrounding them to strengthen their own¬†</i><i>narratives as well as that of all those around\nthem. It is the characteristic of a person who¬†</i><i>constantly takes on multiple perspectives and is\nable to use them accordingly.</i></p><p>¬†<b>What has been your biggest leadership failure?\nAnd what did you learn?</b></p><p><i>Two failures in particular come to mind. One was\nwhen I was a good deal younger and was¬†</i><i>responsible for managing individuals much older\nthan myself. Being so young, at the time I¬†</i><i>didn‚Äôt realize the importance of setting a proper\ntone for the work environment and of the¬†</i><i>nuances involved in coworker relations. Now, I\nhandle the same challenge by approaching each¬†</i><i>situation uniquely and with humility. What I\nview as the more important failure however, is the¬†</i><i>instance of having individuals being left behind\nwho I wasn‚Äôt able to reach out to or connect with on an individual level. For\nexample, if I see someone who after a program or meeting is sitting alone and\ndidn‚Äôt contribute, or wasn‚Äôt integrated into the larger group interaction or\nconversation, that for me is a leadership failure. It means that I wasn‚Äôt able\nto create an environment that was as ¬†inclusive as it needed to be. That\nteaches me to think about the people on the fringes; how can I be mindful of,\nand attract those individuals?</i></p><p>¬†<b>What is one word or idea that you seek to\nredefine by the end of your career?</b></p><p>¬†<i>If I can work towards redefining people‚Äôs\nunderstandings of a single concept it would be that of¬†</i><i>‚Äúshared humanity.‚Äù Once in college\n¬†a highly educated peer who was serving the country in the armed forces\nresponded to a debate we were engaged in regarding national responsibility to\nrespond to overseas refugee crises, an issue even more relevant today. He\nstated something along the lines of ‚Äúit‚Äôs not our problem, why should we be\nsucked into their mess?‚Äù That was devastating for me. I didn‚Äôt ¬†think that\nyoung man was ¬†a bad individual but so many people today would agree with\nhis stance. If I could just impart onto others this notion that we are tied to\none another no matter what small corner of the globe we may find ourselves in,\nwe are tied to each other by virtue of our humanity. When we understand how\npowerless we actually are in determining what circumstance we‚Äôre born into, it\nbecomes clear that to value your life over another‚Äôs by virtue of living in a\nplace that is better off or having access to certain resources, that is the\nworst type of arrogance possible. And if we can‚Äôt care for one another by\nsimple virtue of our shared humanity, then really, what are we trying to\naccomplish in life?</i></p><p><b>Please describe a defining moment in your life\nthat has shaped your values.</b></p><p><i>I believe the defining moment in my life was\nlosing my father after my high school graduation. Sometimes it takes a\nlife-changing event to make you ask yourself tough questions¬†</i><i>about who it is you actually are? What type of\nperson do you want to be and what will it take¬†</i><i>for you to get there? Unfortunately, our culture\nin the U.S., and in New York in particular is not¬†</i><i>necessarily always conducive to self-reflection\nand mindful meditation and so I find that often¬†</i><i>we rush through life without challenging our own\nbeliefs and practices and getting to the¬†</i><i>core of why we do what we do. I think constant\nself-reflection is something we need to¬†</i><i>encourage more, especially among young adults\nand adolescents.</i></p><p>¬†<i>For me personally, when I had to face the hard\nreality of overcoming tragedy as I began college,¬†</i><i>I realized that at some point I had to live my\nlife according to what I believed in. There‚Äôs no use¬†</i><i>in having philosophies and moral judgments if\nyou‚Äôre not going to stand by them with your¬†</i><i>actions. This has greatly shaped how I interact\nwith others to this day and my efforts to lead¬†</i><i>genuinely, with integrity.</i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130340401453,"NoteCount":19,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZrCISo1vOvB4j","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>Upper East Side</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130337465766,"NoteCount":10,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vOj_Mc","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>Of all the freshmen stereotypes, there is one that shines brighter than the infamous lanyard: not exploring the city beyond 14th Street.

She has an extensive background and record in governance, higher education, and community and political organizing.<b><br/></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"254\" data-orig-height=\"253\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/3e7ea18437dc6fbfaa435e8795456825/tumblr_inline_nvicux1n9v1t25dex_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"254\" data-orig-height=\"253\"/></figure><p><b>How do you define leadership?</b></p><p><i>Early on, my time in the military and other challenging environments taught me what leadership is not: leadership is not individualistic, it‚Äôs not about prestige, power, or managing things or people merely to check boxes. Leadership to me is the living, holistic embodiment of values centered on inspiring others to be their best selves for positive influence and impact. In this vein, leadership to me is about community, integrity, respect.</i></p><p><b>What has been your biggest leadership failure? And what did you learn?</b></p><p><i>I find the paradox of leadership fascinating&ndash;something so often glorified and put on a pedestal, yet leadership is often a messy, challenging, isolating place to live. Many of the best leaders I know are ones who‚Äôve known hardship, thus their fearlessness to jump in no matter the challenge, often leading the way out of passion for people, communities, or larger-than-life issues. My whole life I‚Äôve been praised for ‚Äúworking under pressure, working well in stress‚Äù and certainly it‚Äôs a honed skill I know I have due to my life experiences. However, my biggest leadership failure has been not asking for help and not having boundaries between my work, and my self care. This continues to be a working challenge for me given my service-minded, community-driven style of leadership. More and more I‚Äôve learned the glorification of productivity and pressure can result in a distorted assumption that leaders should be working under constant duress or else they aren‚Äôt truly committed to their cause, community, or ¬†team. I‚Äôve learned that if I don‚Äôt take care of myself, I can‚Äôt be my best self, and I can‚Äôt ask others to be theirs.</i></p><p><b>What is one word or idea that you seek to redefine by the end of your career?</b></p><p><i>An idea I seek to redefine has to do with dissent, differing opinions, and being okay with not being 100% right. In a time of great advancements we are still very much stagnant, even regressing, when it comes to our potential as a society. I attribute much of this to general, strengthening sentiment of individuals needing to never be wrong or vulnerability seen as a weakness. Many things in our lives are starkly polarized&ndash;yes or no, black or white. Yet the shining lights of opportunity and solution are often in the grey, in differing sides being open to new perspectives and ideas and finding middle ground of better understanding. Too often stepping outside the status quo box is punishable, ridiculed, chastised. We are tremendously more than capable of unlearning things we‚Äôve thought to be whole truths, to be vulnerable, to get uncomfortable if it means coming out stronger, wiser, more interconnected. Boxes of linear thinking keep us caged, ignorant, and limited to our true collective potential.</i></p><p><b>Please describe a defining moment in your life that has shaped your values.</b></p><p><i>Growing up I spent a lot of time with my mother, a single parent who immigrated to the U.S. from Honduras. In Honduras she was discovered as a prodigal basketball player, a life she left behind to give me opportunity and a better life. As a child I saw her face many challenges, language, and culture barriers. Yet despite having few means ourselves, my mother would always, without hesitation, go out of her way to help people. From speaking with the cleaning staff at the mall in Spanish, to staying with a man who had a seizure at a bus stop until the ambulance came. She was always reaching out to strangers in kindness without expecting anything back. I once asked her why she felt she had to do this. In her ever-convicted voice she reminded me that people are people, just like us, no matter if it&rsquo;s the President of the United States, or someone without a home. She subconsciously taught me to act with compassion no matter my own circumstances, to respect others no matter their lot in life, and the impacts we can make if we step outside our comfort zones. She inspired the leader I am today.<br/></i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130223711524,"NoteCount":45,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTBl8y1vHy2Ka","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>shoutout to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mIEziGcKiIpIdF3f_3gFsjw\">hashtagnyu</a> on Twitter for this little nugget of great information</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130222878964,"NoteCount":37,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vHut3q","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130222089613,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZqZNar1vHrsMD","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130221890061,"NoteCount":9,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vHr5eD","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Winter is coming and <a href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/115850879211/10-ways-nyu-is-actually-game-of-thrones\">no one knows that better than NYU students</a>, of course.

However, Coney Island is an activity that isn‚Äôt the same during winter hibernation, so be sure to make this trip soon.</p><br/><h2>Walk the High Line</h2><a href=\"http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hm70l.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/734bdc936619ba7901f6f3466a442588/tumblr_inline_nvibndH0Ur1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\"/></figure></a><p>It‚Äôs way easier to lazily stroll down the High Line when you don‚Äôt have to power walk to keep your body temp up. Take advantage of the warmth and check out the beautiful greenery, great views, and perfect backgrounds for your next profile picture.</p><br/><h2>Picnic in a park</h2><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/sofia-coppola-AA1nGh6NaTWX6\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/9b2cd83238c61625e6e86ea705ad1b2f/tumblr_inline_nvibno559D1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\"/></figure></a><p>Your mind may have automatically assumed Central Park, but <a href=\"http://www.nycgovparks.org/maps\">there are so many more parks to choose from</a>! Head over to Brooklyn and spend the day in Prospect Park or venture to Queens and relax your afternoon away in Flushing Meadows. So many options, so little time!</p><br/><h2>Gaze into the distance on a rooftop</h2><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/new-york-city-cinemagraph-k9y2fq2WTTbR6\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"429\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/0519641e120ce32150b783c92038099b/tumblr_inline_nvibnyomLA1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"429\"/></figure></a><p>While some cities are built outwards, Manhattan was built upwards. This means there are a lot of amazing NYC rooftops with breathtaking views. You and your squad could easily spend a few hours on the MET rooftop looking over Central Park. You could even take a yoga class, catch a film, or mini golf ‚Äî all on a rooftop! Definitely do this before all roofs are mostly covered in snow&hellip;</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130221413598,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZzGUeo1vHpHJU","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>#NYU #NYC #stroll #colorful #cobblestonestreets #architecture #design #nycdesign #what_I_saw_in_NYC #thebigapple #thevillage #bluesurfstudio #nikon #ig_nyc #igersoftheday #photo #photogram #University #scenesfromthecity #pulledoverforthis #Sundaystroll #streetnook #charming #nyspots #theamericancollective</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130220427134,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z4ZN8v1vHlWT_","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Silent short film for Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking at NYU, 2014.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130220396629,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z4ZN8v1vHlP1L","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Short film as final for Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking at NYU, 2014.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130206152457,"NoteCount":5,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZfcBCt1vGv3S9","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":33231264464,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlVX6yUylDhG","DateString":"2012-10-09","Text":"<p>feel like my professor just wanted us to look at softcore porn between cupid and psyche all period with these painting. ¬†</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":20377690429,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z72nVyI_ck4z","DateString":"2012-04-03","Text":"<p>Everything is pretty much within a 5 minute radius of the Washington Square area. Tisch may haves lectures or classes held in Cantor, I&rsquo;m not sure, but that&rsquo;s only like 4 blocks away from the WS area at most. The only other places I could think of that classes are held are on Mercer Street and 12th St (about a 15 minute walk I&rsquo;d say from Washington Sq), but classes held there are usually things like MAP courses (science, math, Writing the Essay) and I&rsquo;m not sure if as a Tisch student you&rsquo;d have to take those. If you do, they probably hold them closer.</p>\n<p>As far as dorms, closest to &ldquo;campus&rdquo; in order would be Goddard, Weinstein, Hayden, Brittany, Rubin, Founders, and Third North.</p>\n<p>Goddard is¬†<strong>on¬†</strong>Washington Square Park, so you&rsquo;d literally be able to roll out of bed 10 minutes before class and get there on time. However, it&rsquo;s a Residence College so you&rsquo;d have to do a separate application for it. Basically do service projects and events with the residents in the building I believe.</p>\n<p>Weinstein isn&rsquo;t on WSP, but it&rsquo;s so close, it might as well be. About a 5 minute walk to classes, just like Goddard.</p>\n<p>Hayden is a little bit farther but not by much, maybe 5 minutes extra. It&rsquo;s on the opposite side of WSP.</p>\n<p>Brittany is on 9th street so it&rsquo;s about 5/6 blocks away, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s open for Freshman next semester due to renovations.</p>\n<p>Rubin is on 10th St I believe. There&rsquo;s no A/C so I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>\n<p>Founders and Third North are on 12th St, being the farthest dorms. Founders has the big rooms, Third North being apartment-style has the kitchens. About a 15-20 minute walk to class, depending on how fast you walk.¬†</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re just concerned about distance, I&rsquo;d stick with <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Goddard-Hall/Feeatures-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Goddard</a>/<a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Weinstein/Features-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weinstein</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Hayden-Hall/Features-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hayden</a>. They each have something to offer. I linked each of them with their NYU page that gives a list of their features and services, in case you wanna know more about them.</p>"}]
