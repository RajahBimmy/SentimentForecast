Thus, the seventh conference will revisit that amazing experience that attracted over 800 attendees – an occasion that brought together artists and scholars from an assortment of disciplines and practices and offered comparative perspectives on the historical and contemporary role played by photography, art, film, literature, and music in referencing the image of the black body in the West. </p><p>Discussions will focus on aesthetics, style, history, and music in describing a sense of place and identity. The conference will also invite visitors to conduct a diverse visual reading of the notion of a black portrait while challenging conventional perspectives on identity, beauty, cosmopolitanism, and community in Africa and its diaspora.  We hope you will join us in New York City!</p><p>Organized by NYU Tisch Office of the Dean, Allyson Green, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the School of the Arts at NYU along with Awam Amkpa (Social and Cultural Analysis; NYU), Ulrich Baer (Vice Provost for Faculty, Arts, Humanities, and Diversity; NYU), Manthia Diawara (Institute of African American Affairs; NYU), Henry Louis Gates, Jr. (Hutchins Center for African and American Research; Harvard), Thelma Golden (Studio Museum in Harlem), Robert Holmes, J.D.

Sue Ann is currently a senior in CAS majoring in Economics. When asked if she has anything to share with everyone, she said:</p><blockquote><p>I want everyone to read this Generasian article.</p></blockquote><p>Right on Sue Ann, now let’s get started!</p><p><b>Tell us about HKSA’s vision:</b></p><p>Our vision, wow. Let me think… Well, Hong Kong has a very weird identity and being a student overseas its sometimes difficult to understand our origin. HKSA is to remind them, remind us, about our origins. (<i>Beautifully said</i>)</p><p><b>What is your favorite thing about HKSA?</b></p><p>The people (<i>AWHHH</i>). The stupidity of the people (<i>awh?</i>)… I like how we always treat each other as family… and of course the food.</p><p><b>Will: Would you rather be giant owl or a small lion?</b></p><p>Small lion because I don’t like to eat mice. </p><p><b>Where is your favorite place to study?</b></p><p>Bobst, LL1 (<i>Let the record show, LL1 is gross</i>) Wait no… home.</p><p><b>Who is your role model?</b></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Hsu\">Dee Hsu</a> or maybe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong-kook_(singer)\">Kim Jong Kook</a>?

But what happens when you use design thinking to integrate technology with book distribution to underserved children? <br/></p><p>In 2007, Hediya Sizar (NYU Steinhardt ‘2017) and her brother Sohale Sizar founded the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books Foundation</a>, a non-profit literacy organization that redistributes gently-used books to low-income neighborhoods in the New York City area. It began as a local book drive at a suburban high school, encouraging high schoolers to reroute their books to low-income schools in Philadelphia.  Since its humble origins, the initiative has grown into an impactful nonprofit organization, collecting over 70,000 books at high school and college campuses across multiple states. With its adaptive nature, the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">organization</a> has begun integrating technology to take the program to the next level. Now run through a cloud-based app platform, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books</a> directly connects donors to donation sites at their nearest location.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"851\" data-orig-height=\"314\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/a16499e75cc428282d72e240da847355/tumblr_inline_o2tfqvvGdh1t25dex_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"851\" data-orig-height=\"314\"/></figure><p>Hediya’s dedication to closing the access-to-books gap is deeply personal. At the age of nine, her parents relocated from her small town in Pennsylvania to South Korea. She recalls that,  “My brother and I were the only international students in my new school. There were many language and cultural barriers, making it difficult to interact with my peers, so I found my sanctuary in books.” Hediya found Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie especially poignant because this 19th century pioneer family maintained positivity and strength throughout unimaginable hardship. Hediya notes, “their story encouraged me to appreciate my experience in South Korea. <b>The characters’ resilience helped me work across differences and learn different perspectives, encouraging me to make friends with my peers in Korea.”</b><br/></p><p>Hediya knows first-hand that the stories found within the pages of books can build across differences. Scaling this vision into a nonprofit organization required taking stock of her own values and how to turn those into a tangible mission.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1502\" data-orig-height=\"911\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/9efafeab684b09f805853c5b07f02f6f/tumblr_inline_o2tfrnSJCo1t25dex_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1502\" data-orig-height=\"911\"/></figure><p>Hediya’s transformative experience as an NYU Leadership Fellow in (Class of 2014-2015) helped her on her journey to becoming a successful leader at Bring on the Books. The highlight of her fellowship was working on a group team challenge. Hediya reflects, “We created a social media campaign and event called #ImNotPerfect, which celebrated our flaws as leaders and encouraged students to be open about vulnerabilities. During the creation of this project, I learned the importance of teamwork and I developed lasting relationships with my team. They are now some of my closest friends!”</p><p>As an NYU Leadership Fellow, Hediya worked one-one-one with a coach to create an individual development plan. Hediya expands that “This helped me learn about myself as a leader and person in life. If it wasn’t for the Fellows Program, I wouldn’t be able to create measurable and effective goals to work on my strengths and areas of growth.” </p><p>She also cites meditation and mindfulness as practices that shape her leadership style. In fact, she participates weekly in <a href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/life/student-life/student-diversity/spiritual-life/mindfulness/student-groups-at-mindfulnyu.html\">Generation Meditation sessions at Global Spiritual Life</a>. She explains, “I incorporate mindfulness with leadership by engaging in empathetic listening, practicing more self-awareness, and learning how to stay focused in the present moment. This has helped create stronger clarity of my vision and be a better team player.” Hediya continues to hone her leadership skills around campus. She serves as a Program Assistant at the NYU Leadership Initiative, helping to grow and facilitate the same fellowship program that enhanced her own leadership skills.</p><p>And as  a Media, Culture, and Communication major in Steinhardt, Hediya utilizes the many resources available to her at NYU to scale up Bring on the Books from the frequent donation model to a technology-driven crowdsourcing platform. In her own words she say says:</p><p>“I wanted to build a love for literacy that would bring youth together. I wanted to share the beauty of stories. I wanted adolescents to know that they are not alone in this world, but rather there are characters who share the same emotions and experiences as them. I pursued my vision through a full time commitment to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/\">Bring on the Books</a>.”<br/></p><p>If you have any books lying around, reroute them  at the “<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BringOnTheBooks/?ref=bookmarks\">Bring on the Books</a>” Drive happening now during Violet 100 Week (Feb. 22nd-26th).

Maybe your parents want to see how their little angel and the love of their life is doing at college, or your friend from high school wants to see what the City is like. While it’s always great to catch up, you can&rsquo;t just hang out in your room, watch Netflix, and go to Third North for lunch. Sometimes it’s tough to plan the day outside of what you’ll have for food, so if you’re struggling for ideas, here’s our first itinerary that will be sure to show off your urban home to parents and best friends alike.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"587\" data-orig-height=\"126\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/69f61fff803053444a3f1a7b345d9782/tumblr_inline_o2t8rtlD6P1ro0zrp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"587\" data-orig-height=\"126\"/></figure><p>Not only do your visitors want to see Bobst, Kimmel, and Washington Square Park, they want to see the City through your eyes. So, start with Washington Square Park area and show them the cool academic buildings, as well as some of the awesome food vendors between campus and 6th Avenue. From there, you can work your way west.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"587\" data-orig-height=\"129\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/940837deb5fcf767d68cd22b9e9e3913/tumblr_inline_o2t8qenl021ro0zrp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"587\" data-orig-height=\"129\"/></figure><p>The West Village is where it gets cool no matter how old you are.

Two food markets? Food markets are a spectacular place to walk around, sample things from multiple vendors, or sit down for a larger, delicious meal. The tacos and Num Pang are great at <a href=\"http://www.chelseamarket.com/\">Chelsea Market</a>, and there’s no clear winner at <a href=\"http://www.gansmarket.com/\">Gansevoort Market</a>, as everything is equally spectacular. </p><p>From there, you can continue up the Highline to Hudson Yards (Catch the 7 train, which leads into midtown) or walk along 23rd Street to the Flatiron Building and Madison Square Park. The park holds Shake Shack’s first location, and the line is worth the wait.

It was\na great job that I learned to pick up things really quick and respond to market\nand client’s request timely and accurately, and I got the chance to work with\npeople from different trading rooms in different branches around the world. Jut\nthat I still fell like some things is missing: every deal is coming and done so\nfast that I don&rsquo;t even have time to think about it, to plan it and put my\nthought in it, everything is according to foreign exchange market. At the mean\ntime, I looked at some of my friends who work in marketing role in\nmarketing-driven companies such as L’Oreal or Pepsi Co, their life is pretty\ndifferent; they plan for marketing campaigns, promotions, and events. They are\ntrained to have fresh eye on the market trend, and use different tools and\napproaches to catch customer needs and cerate opportunities. This sounds more\nlike a job I can do and enjoy for a long time, so I decided to leave JPMorgan\nand applied for master in marketing program in states, trying to change my\ncareer path.</p><p>After one semester here, though those basic\nmarketing classes, internship experience and some events such as advertising\nweek and marketing mix in NYU Stern, I’ve learned so much about digital\nmarketing. Digital marketing world is like a comprehensive ecosystem and it\nkeeps changing every day. From my previous intern at an e-commerce start-up, I\nlearned to observe customer behavior through Google Trend, Google Analytics and\nGoogle AdWords; and use those information to create marketing campaign for\nsocial media platforms, website, emails, and influencers outreach. Fortunately\nall these effort turned out to be actual sales and increased likes in social\nmedia platforms, I feel like that we have built a good connection with\ncustomers. From all these precious experiences I found myself enjoy doing\ndigital marketing strategies, so I’m excited to take the digital marketing\nclass this semester to learn more of it, and apply to my internship and job in\nthe future. ：）</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139525250422,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zck7wh21yMbrs","DateString":"2016-02-18","Text":"<p>Some girl in the laundry room today was like, “Hamilton has a lottery?” Yes, yes it does friends.

She was prepared: she had a vision for the company, a business plan, and a business partner in her husband Rob King.</p><p>But there was just one thing holding her back: student loan debt. And a lot of it.</p><p>True graduated with her MFA in acting from New York University in 1998, and worked for more than a decade as a performer in New York and Los Angeles.</p><p>“When they interviewed me for admission to NYU as part of the admission process, they asked me ‘How do you plan on paying for it?’” she recalls.</p><!-- more -->\n\n<blockquote><ul><li><b>Who:</b> Noel True</li>\n<li><b>Lives in:</b> Los Angeles, Calif.</li>\n<li><b>Profession:</b> Founder, Little Pictures production company</li>\n<li><b>Her degree:</b> MFA, 1998, New York University</li>\n<li><b>Annual cost of attendance (two semesters), 2015:</b> $88,000</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was 21 years old and I thought, ‘Well, I don’t know how right now, but I know this is what I’m going to be doing for the rest of my life. I know I’m passionate about it, and I know I’ll find a way.’”</p>\n\n<p>That “way” included taking more than $100,000 in student loans for graduate school.</p><p>But the unpredictable schedule of being a working actor on shows like <i>Veronica Mars</i>, <i>Bones</i> and <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> meant that her income — and paying off her loans — was erratic. True had to use loan forbearance several times and that meant she fell behind on paying them off for good.</p>\n\n\n\n                    \n                    <figure data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/earnest-static-assets/blog/student+loan+refinancing+NYU+MFA+2.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"600\" data-orig-height=\"400\"/></figure><h3>Moving behind the camera</h3><p>Then, in 2010, True decided to move behind the scenes and began freelancing in the video production business. She officially formed her own company, <a href=\"http://littlepictures.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Little Pictures</a>, in 2012.</p><p>While her professional life was moving forward, her loan burden remained and affected her personal financial progress. In fact, when she and her husband decided to buy a house, they omitted her name from the loan so she would not appear as a liability.</p><p>At that point, she says, her students loans payments were so large and the principal had been capitalized so many times, “I was beginning to wonder if I was going to be paying for my children’s grad school before I even paid off my own grad school.”</p><blockquote><p><i>Noel’s money tips:</i></p><p><b>1. Research newer <a href=\"http://blog.meetearnest.com/post/133822756882/compare-student-loan-refinancing-companies\" target=\"_blank\">refinancing options</a> even if you have been out of school for many years.</b>“For so many years policies changed but they never included people like me who’d been out of school for so long or whose debt was so great or who had exhausted their forbearance efforts.”</p><p><br/><b>2. Get your personal finances in order to improve your professional finances.</b>&ldquo;When starting your own business, your financial house has to be in order, your intentions have to be in order, and your confidence and your abilities have to be in order.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><h3>A new peace of mind</h3><p>Even though she had been out of school for more than 15 years, she began researching options to help get her student loan debt into a better place especially now that she was running a successful production company.</p><p>Earnest, she says, appealed to her for its <a href=\"http://blog.meetearnest.com/post/131230998947/how-does-earnest-compare-to-traditional-lenders\" target=\"_blank\">non-traditional way</a> of considering borrowers.</p><p>That included people like herself: self-employed and had the means to pay back a loan but didn’t necessarily look that great in a traditional model on paper. “I needed to refinance so I could take back my life and not have this thing from 18 years ago hanging over my head as I started a new venture in my life,” she says. </p><p>True&rsquo;s story bucks the current narrative that student loans are holding back entrepreneurship. While startup activity by younger Americans is <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/12/new-hope-for-young-entrepreneurs-strangled-by-student-debt.html\" target=\"_blank\">below historical trends</a>, True&rsquo;s experience reveals how entrepreneurs saddled with student loan debt are finding innovative ways to deal with it.</p><p>By refinancing, she shaved $400 off her monthly payments and reduced her term from 12 to four years.</p><p>Today, getting her student loan debt into a better place has helped her to be able to fully focus on the growth of her company, and better satisfy employees and customers.</p><p>“Student loans used to be something that I thought about constantly. Now that mental bandwidth is occupied with much more constructive things like how to grow my business or how to offer new products to my clients or how I can be of service.”</p>\n<p><b>New to Earnest?</b><i> Earnest is a technology company using software automation, smart design, and exceptional service to restore trust in the lending industry and help clients take control of their finances. </i></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetearnest.com/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=CTA_ad&amp;utm_campaign=CTA_ads_blog\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/earnest-static-assets/blog/680x147_CTA_refinance_earnest.jpg\" title=\"Meet Earnest\" width=\"680”\" height=\"147”\" alt=\"image\"/></a></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139443093053,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zf4Zzh21tTBuz","DateString":"2016-02-16","Text":"<p>i’ll be making a housing guide complete with links to wsn’s housing guides, pros and cons, and my personal experience with the dorms. if there are any other guides people would like to see, send me an an ask!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139441602526,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZcFv4o21tNV-U","DateString":"2016-02-16","Text":"<p>The sky is crying 😓💧#nyc #nyu (at NYU Kimmel Center for University Life)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139441345809,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZRAIto21tMXKH","DateString":"2016-02-16","Text":"<p>Best part about studying abroad in my own country is that I can go on weekend trips to visit my family!

Didn&rsquo;t even thought about doing usually. The same went for this night. Aira&rsquo;s eyes stared upwards to the skies, looked at the unclouded nightsky, that seemed to be so easily reachable. She listened to some voices. Calm and definitly not angry at her, most not even nooticing her at all.</p>\n\n<p>Only one voice&hellip;definitly was aware of her.</p>\n\n<p>¤ So? Do you think, this will work out, Aira? ¤</p>\n\n<p>The stargazer simply smiled and closed her eyes, sighing out loudly. &ldquo;I mean &hellip; things changed &hellip;&rdquo;, she whispered as an answer, a rusty laugh returning.

The following silence was incredible deep and long, swallowing all sounds, that they could make, as she slowed her breathing, preparing for the conversation.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You wonder who I was talking to&hellip;right?&rdquo;, she simply said without turning towards the person that was behind her somewhere. The leaves of the tree she was sitting in rustled from the wind, her hair hiding her face for a moment, as she closed her eyes. &ldquo;You wonder if I am talking to myself.

Implemented within supportive New York City community schools, the program helps support children with ASD “learn how to function well academically, behaviorally, and socially in school and in their community,” without isolating them from their peers and the rest of their school environment. For more detail about the NEST program and model, see this <a href=\"http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/asdnest/about/doe\">brochure</a> and this <a href=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/95239747\">video</a>.</p><p>Since I didn’t know anything about the NEST program prior to my visit, I was excited to absorb as much information as possible. Since this visit was organized through the fabulous <a href=\"http://schools.nyc.gov/Academics/InterschoolCollaboration/showcase\">Showcase Schools</a> program, not only did the group of educators gathered at the school hear from its principal and teachers, but we also visited multiple classrooms in order to see elements of the program in action. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/817d132801d7cb7cdc114d2d4cfb95a9/tumblr_inline_o2ew96sITQ1qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>Some of the most striking examples of smart thinking and strategies for ASD-focused inclusion were the simplest — and also often ones that had clear benefit for all students in the class. For instance, the school had developed basic <i>movement </i>and <i>volume </i>scales to help kids rank their movement and voice level in the classroom and hallways. </p><p>Another ingenious and simple example was the problem scale, which helps kids determine whether the issue they’re experiencing is more of a 1 at a “glitch” level, or a 5 at the other end of the spectrum, which is an emergency requiring intense adult help. Tools like these scales provide a method and vocabulary for kids to use in both identifying and explaining the problem they face, as well as learning what qualifies as an appropriate response. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/70d3d543512105da5ea8db6f928f8cff/tumblr_inline_o2ewa7zyso1qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>Lastly, every classroom I visited had constructed a “break area,” where students could take a self-elected pause from whatever was happening in class to calm down or find a moment of quiet. The break areas were outfitted with comfortable seating such as a bean bag, and various things to read or play with; one even had candles on a shelf that kids could smell. The idea was to provide a safe space to self-soothe and regain composure away from peers — something I think most adults in the workforce would beg for if they had the opportunity! Tools like this break area not only echo some of the workplace psychology influencing the office environments of tech companies like Google and Facebook, but also encourage self-care and health of the ‘whole child,’ not just the academic student. </p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"><img src=\"https://40.media.tumblr.com/89e93932fc7762602c2799c41323e70d/tumblr_inline_o2ewauo3D51qigx26_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/></figure><p>While I was impressed by the teachers I saw in the classrooms, I was mostly surprised and heartened by the children. The students in these classrooms exemplified a range of learners — some held onto “<a href=\"https://www.therapyshoppe.com/category/1052-fidget-toys-classroom-fidgets-focus-concentration-toys-tools\">fidgets</a>” to help keep their hands occupied while they listed, some wore noise-canceling headphones while reading, some used the support of bouncy ball chairs or ‘pitch scales’ to monitor their own voices. All of them, however, were happy and eager to explain their tools; none were embarrassed or susceptible to the idea that these tools meant they were at all ‘less than’ or had ‘special needs.’ It was a helpful reminder that sending the message that <i>everyone</i> has needs, and that we should embrace the tools that help us each meet them, is an extremely important thing for teachers and schools to do in cultivating a healthy, supportive and inclusive community. Go, NEST ASD program!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139141727456,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_yq4t21bVaJW","DateString":"2016-02-12","Text":"<p>DRUM TAO Presents DRUM HEART #nyu #skirball  (at Skirball Center for the Performing Arts)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139141137743,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z2jDEt21bTKLF","DateString":"2016-02-12","Text":"<p>Havent seen a show in such a long time!

And what is even more wonderful is that there was a window seat in Argo Tea. As I drink some hibiscus apple cider - because today is very fucking cold - I&rsquo;m just looking out at the street. Greene and Washington Place. It&rsquo;s one of those little moments when I sort of breathe in the everydayness that still surprises me. It still surprises me that I&rsquo;m here. Today me and some friends from high school were talking and laughing about old times. When I think back to those times, it kind of astounds me I&rsquo;m here now; so far away, and in the place I had always wanted to go. A place I&rsquo;d never even seen until after I left school. I am so beyond happy that I&rsquo;m here. Even though it&rsquo;s crazy, busy, stressful, tiring and sometimes not easy. But I like that it&rsquo;s not a simple place where nothing happens. I like walking with people who know how to walk. I like doing homework in the library and seeing the financial district grow dark outside. I like glancing out of my bedside window to see what colour the Empire State Building is each night before I go to sleep - if it&rsquo;s before 2am, that is. I like drinking overpriced coffee and pretending to be American when I order it. Mostly I love seeing my friends and acquaintances every day and talking to them about anything. They&rsquo;re all such beautiful, fun, smart people and after even a two minute conversation I feel a burst of happiness that I am lucky to have met all of these wonderful people. From all walks of life and backgrounds with a vast array of paths and goals. I love the people who live in this city. And when it&rsquo;s all getting too much and overwhelming, I remind myself of the girl I used to be, who spent her every waking and sleeping moment desperate to be here, doing what I am doing. I wouldn&rsquo;t change my time at the Atlantic for anything. It has been precious and invaluable and beautiful. Even if they do send us off campus too much. I do love it. And even though my goals and dreams today are not the same as the goals and dreams I had when I was sixteen, they&rsquo;re still completely bound up with this city and all the experiences I have undergone here. I&rsquo;m promising myself that I&rsquo;ll never take anything about this place for granted. None of it. Well. I finished my tea and now my free time is done. I&rsquo;ve got to run to my Zionism and Israel class, one of the most fascinating things I&rsquo;ve ever learned about and something else on the endless list of things I&rsquo;m thankful to have in my life. So happy. So stressed. So blessed. Total mess. That&rsquo;s my life and I wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139122099347,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z0xUWt21aKiIJ","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p>Day like today makes me long for Spring like this shot of #washingtonsquare park with the early tress blooming! #NewYorkfromAbove #newbook #aerialphotography #helicopter #newyork #architecturalphotography #architecture #landmark #greenwichvillage #nyu  (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139121124736,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zdflmv21aG_M0","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p>avian species are occasionally cooperative #washingtonsquarepark #nyuvibe #nyu  (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":139114590616,"NoteCount":25,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv21Zu36O","DateString":"2016-02-11","Text":"<p><figure data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/2fb4a57df24d736ef7b7ae54cd0fa5ea/tumblr_inline_o232cxKJzk1ro0zrp_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1920\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/></figure></p><p>Valentine’s Day is coming up, and you’ve had your eyes set on your cute floormate for the past couple of days now.

Being a Chinese adoptee I wanted to return to my home country on a mission of self discovery. During the NYUSH application process I focused on essay writing, interview skills and the like. I didn’t focus on the price tag because I doubted I would get admitted.</p><p> Once admitted I was thrilled for a good five minutes before I checked my NYU account and realized how much financial aid I would receive. I’d heard of people getting full rides and how the Shanghai campus apparently had better FA than the NY campus. When I learned I’d only be getting $20k a year off the $63k tuition I was crushed by the idea that by the time I graduate I will be hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. </p><p> My parents were very supportive. They said they’d try to help me out and that I should chase my dreams. They also brought up the point that attending NYU could be a good investment in my future. I, however, was not so sure. I’d read various articles informing me not to drop huge amounts of money for my undergrad degree and horror stories of NYU grads being crushed with debt and without a solid job. I had other schools offering me much more affordable tuition and only two weeks to decide (since I’d applied to NYUSH ED). </p><p>After many hours of tossing and turning late at night, sometimes crying to myself, I finally decided to go for it. While I’m still scared about the debt prospects, I truly believe that down the line I will regret not going for my dreams more than spending too much on my tuition.

The art ranges from the visually beautiful to the unnerving and intellectually engaging; from Aleister Crowley’s alter ego self-portrait, Ken Henson’s portrait of the goddess Ishtar, Robert Buratti’s dreamy Sub Rosa and Paul Laffoley’s Astrological Ouroboros, with the twelve signs of the zodiac paired with the twelve stages of changes of attitude toward life - each piece challenges you to feel rather than analyze.</p><br/><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Speaking to <em>Luna Luna</em> about the current appeal magic and the occult has on the younger generation, Grossman cited that for women it honors cycles and gives agency, “witchcraft is about embracing the body,&quot;  she says.

My classes are all in the Old Town, the most touristy area of Prague. Most shopkeepers there know how to speak English or are extremely kind when I try my remedial Czech with them. </p><p>For instance, the lady who runs the coffee shop next to the NYU building is very sweet. I think she is very familiar with all the NYU students who pass by her shop before and after class for our New York college student coffee fix. She smiles at us when we say “Dobry den” as a greeting and “Dekuju” of “Diky” as a thanks, but she takes our orders in English and is generally a very positive woman. I think she’s probably one of the more openly cheerful Czech people I’ve encountered here, as the general disposition of most Czechs towards strangers is more reserved than Americans. </p><p>There are a few times when I go out around my dorm in Holesovice that I encounter the language barrier. When I go to the grocery store here, I have to hope and pray that pointing, smiling, and saying “American” is enough to get them to understand my confusion. </p><p>I am always a little embarrassed when that happens, but I’ve gotten used to reading the situation and “doing as the locals do.” Maybe my hesitance to just leap into new situations head first is a sign that I’m not totally comfortable here in Prague yet, but I think my observations of how locals behave on the trams, in the super markets, on the streets, etc. has let me integrate a lot more smoothly (if a little more slowly).  </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138802762946,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zdflmv21HIXJ2","DateString":"2016-02-06","Text":"<p>⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️⛄️<br/>\n#nyu #washingtonsquarepark  (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138800531703,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTU3by21HA0Zt","DateString":"2016-02-06","Text":"<p>our hacked times square screens #nyu #itp #outragemachine</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138798742365,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv21H3BjT","DateString":"2016-02-06","Text":"<p>NYU is known for its extensive global network.

Shoot! Edit!. Just as we’re rapping up, the woman sitting across from me and next to my sister is like “oh hey, you’re a film student at NYU? Want to come and do this job for me with a bunch of famous people?” She name drops a few people, gives me her number, and tells me to call her tomorrow. </p><p>So, I’m sitting here like, “WTF just happened?” and my sister, my mom and I are having this three way chat where my mom’s like “this is sketchy, what if she’s a serial kidnapper” and my sister’s like, “OH MY GOD SHE TEXTED OUR PICTURE TO [INSERT FAMOUS PERSON HERE]” and I’m like, “oh wow this is going to be awesome.” </p><p>So, on Sunday I talk to her on the phone and she basically tells me that this could shoot my career up and I’m like “omg this is sick” and she’s telling me all about the doors and opportunities that will open up for me in the next four years and then she tells me the date of the shoot (which is in a few weeks) and then we say goodbye. Little did I know, I would spend the rest of the week being harassed by my parents about the possibility of a kidnapping. I’ll admit, the situation was different, and being cautious is probably better than not being cautious, but I like to think there’s some good left in humanity and that this woman is going to get my film career started.</p><p>Sunday was pretty normal: I officially joined <a href=\"http://wsnunderthearch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Under the Arch</a> (which is basically the bloggy and creative version of <a href=\"http://www.nyunews.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Square News</a>) and attended my first meeting as one of Assistant Managers for Cabaret. Both were very enjoyable, and I cannot wait to see how Cabaret is going to be in April! So that was the weekend.</p><p>Now on to the week: Monday was pretty mundane (for my normal week, not in general). I went to class and then rehearsal (where I got to watch the cast sing and dance so that was cool). Tuesday was a little more fun.

Our aunt was there (and made an awesome homemade dinner!!!) and we all sat around and talked until I snagged a ride home in my sister’s Lyft and did homework while singing Hannah Montana songs with my roommates. </p><p>This Thursday was my first recitation ever in college, and I found it to be surprisingly nice (before recitation, that line said “boring and unhelpful to my college career so that’s saying something). We were greeted by a seemingly chill TA, and she basically showered us in chocolate (which I happen to love so she’s already won me over) and I made some friends&ndash; in fact, I had lunch with one of the girls I met in recitation today. I might officially incorporate anthropology my concentration after this semester. </p><p>Anyhow, that was my week.

Community-wise,\nI think the reason I try to look out for these kinds of opportunities to get\ninvolved in the College of Nursing is because since freshman year, I always\nfelt like there was this disparity between underclassman and upperclassmen, mainly\nbecause of the curriculum and the different workload, what’s required, but also\nnow there’s a physical disparity which was never there before. So I think\nthat’s also been difficult—trying to become a part of the NYUCN community. I’m\nexcited to start doing this kind of work—I think it’ll be a good experience to finally\nrealize I’m becoming a nurse, that in 2 years I’ll be taking the NCLEX…I just\nfeel like I’ll have no idea what it’s like to be a nurse until I’m taking the\ncourses needed to become one.

As you trudge across the Washington Square campus with your new WTE books and slowly start questioning your decision to have 8 AMs, an asked question may be: <b>“Are you going to the SnoBall Dance next Friday?”</b> (Think <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1485309298431166.1073741852.1400018983626865&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\">NYU Welcome Week Music Festi-Ball </a>but the Spring Semester version). As the theme for this year’s 10th Annual SnoBall dance is Hollywood, feel free to pull out your Weekend Best, 8 AM Worst, or that brand new fashion piece you’ve been itching to wear. And also, understand the efforts and intentionality the 2019 Class Activities Board has put into making this NYU tradition a reality.</p><p><b>While there may be elements of the Oscars in our Hollywood-themed SnoBall aesthetics and decorations, we want you to know that we acknowledge the Oscars can be problematic.</b> Recently, there’s been a social movement that has gained visibility on Social Media and in the news – <b>#OscarsSoWhite</b>. Why? This movement calls attention to the absence of color and diversity seen in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ 2016 Oscar nominees. <b>For the second year in a row, ALL 20 actors/actresses nominated in the lead and supporting acting categories are white.</b> In the Academy Awards’ 88-year history, only 14 black actors have won acting Oscars. Furthermore, representation of people of color of other identities is even lower. In the history of the Oscars, only 5 Latino actors have won (most recently, Benicio Del Toro in 2001) and only 3 Asian actors have been recognized with a win (the last was Haing S. Ngor in 1985). These facts were found in this <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/02/oscars-academy-award-nominations-diversity/79645542/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, please let us know if you have other info for us to amend our facts.</p><p>In response, many actors made a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/movies/spike-lee-jada-pinkett-smith-oscars.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to boycott the Oscars</a> in solidarity if no changes were made. In spreading their message, the movement has gained widespread support. Amidst the movement, the 51-member committee decided the implementation of new rules. Some of these include a commitment to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/la-et-mn-oscars-reform-20160123-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">doubling the number of women and minorities in the academy by 2020</a> and limiting lifetime voting rights.</p><p><b>With the 2019 Class Activities Board’s (CAB19) SnoBall Dance coming up, we are excited to celebrate the diversity that NYU and New York City has offered us this past semester.</b> Be sure to check out <a href=\"https://orgsync.com/119075/forms/182815\" target=\"_blank\">our own nomination process</a> that we created to celebrate our NYU 2019 community.

The spotlight cuts in and out, every three seconds or so, finally revealing that she is using only the arch at the back of her neck to remain suspended, hundreds of feet in the air.<br/></p><p>Music usually accompanies acts like these. But Ocktobre pointedly leaves the background noise out of this performance, and the effect is electrifying: each gasp from the audience is amplified. The only light in the theatre is a single shaking spotlight on the performer’s near-naked body, above an unlit chandelier. Circus isn’t usually like that—in fact, it’s an art form known for its flashing lights and intricate costumes. </p><p>But the aim of Circus Now is to test everything we think we know about circus. It’s an ancient art form that began in Europe and was later brought to America, where it evolved into what we see today—think elephants and sequins. Circus Now is different. They let the talent of their artists do the talking, not their elephants or set displays. The show wasn’t a display of “progressive” circus at all, but instead a return to what the circus genre was built upon: the talent of the artist.  </p><p>The Acrobatic Conundrum, which performed Thursday night, included a solo act by a Cyr wheel artist, who began by imploring us, the audience, to look at him instead of the other acrobats on stage. This spiraled into a monologue about perfectionism and the struggle for attention in a high-tension performing art. Then he lunged into a meticulously timed display of superhuman strength and skill, while standing inside the Cyr wheel and grasping it’s rim, causing it to spin gyroscopically and performing acrobatic moves inside the rotating wheel. </p><p>We sat startlingly close to members of the Bindlestiff Family Circus, and other (remarkably well-dressed—think, sideshow-vintage-chic) fans of circus. </p><p>The Emcee, Sxip Shirey, shared stories about his international circus travels, and an audience member corrected his details, “No, that act used five rigs, not three!” Someone else shouted “Hallo!” when Sxip mentioned a German troupe he toured with fifteen years ago. We begin to get the feeling that everyone in the theatre is somehow connected. And that I, a mere outsider to the mysterious and illustrious world of circus, was bid a very welcome entry to their world, led me to realize why people run away to the circus: </p><p>Acceptance. It’s an embrace, no, a glorification—of every uncategorized or perceivably “strange” talent that wouldn’t have a context anywhere else. And people cheer encore for it. </p><p>Outside I sipped coffee during intermission, and ran into a small band of jugglers, the next act, who were waiting to walk on stage. They said hello in unison as I walked by, as if they weren’t holding bowling pins in each hands and wearing uniforms. “Hello,” I said. “My name is Nicole.” They fumbled to trade bowling pins so we could shake hands, one by one. And after I left the music kicked in, and they went on stage. </p><p>Circus looks different from the inside: it’s a warm, welcoming environment where you can forget about reality for a while as the very laws of gravity are defied and your heart soars. In Circus Now the roots of circus are exposed, and the art form has never been more bracing. Moreover, I now have a bunch of friends who travel the world in caravans. </p><hr><p>Information on Circus Now 2016 can be found on <a href=\"http://nyuskirball.org/calendar/cn2016\" target=\"_blank\">NYU Skirball’s website</a>. </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138616380908,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZyfQYl216BXti","DateString":"2016-02-03","Text":"<p><em>read this in a british accent</em></p>\n\n<p>classes have started, and my semester at n.y.u. in london has begun. more than anything, this post is meant as a way for me to map out my next few writings. i&rsquo;ve kept a running list of ideas since the previous semester, and i think it&rsquo;s quite time i start removing some items. i had originally planned using this post to discuss my usage of various messaging platforms, however it appears that there is too much to say in too little time. it shall be the post following this one.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138612254733,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlwUGq215xoWD","DateString":"2016-02-03","Text":"<p>Throwback when Marty @martinscorsese_ speaking to us and for us at graduation.

We often see good design in our everyday life and we just don’t notice it. It could be your own business card or the stop sign on the street. All these things are designed in a way to grab your attention while still being visually appealing to the eye.</p><p>I think the most important concept I learned was proximity. I didn’t really notice before how having an object next to another can affect the designs outcome so much. Being well aligned and proximate allows for good organization in your design. Another key topic was white space, which I thought was very useful. You want to leave enough whitespace to focus the design on a few aspects but not so much that it looks barren and boring. All these points are crucial for good design that doesn’t make your eyes hurt and can be easy to read to get your message across effectively.</p><p>Something that confused me I would say was repetition. We are expected to make a design look random, but at the same time intentional. How can one do that effectively? Can we be randomly intentional? We must keep the consistency the same but in a random and intentional order. </p><p>I think the photo below is a good representation of alignment and proximity because of its ample white space. This helps maintain the center of attention for  its audience while being simple enough to convey a clear message. The logo and tag line at the bottom also help the viewer know who mad it just in case they are unfamiliar with the company without overpowering the message. I think this is also a good example of repetition because you see the logo twice on the ad. In the spring itself and in the corner of the ad that way the audience will leave knowing who the ad is for and what they are selling.</p><p><br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"658\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/0178bd8ec156a2de446baa0147b4387f/tumblr_inline_o1xebk5OFf1u069dx_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"564\" data-orig-height=\"658\"/></figure>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138545017796,"NoteCount":8,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv211xJF4","DateString":"2016-02-02","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138532585941,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zn8DBi211Bu7L","DateString":"2016-02-02","Text":"<p>This past Sunday (Jan. 31, 2016) was a FUNday..!</p><p>Amanda, Serena, Ryosuke, Benson, and I took this free day as an opportunity to explore Sydney on our own.

I’m sure there is a better term for the style, but unfortunately, I haven’t taken an architecture tour yet. Soon, I promise!</p>\n<p>The food here is one of my favorite things I’ve experienced so far. Beer culture is alive and well in this city. First and foremost, Czechs are proud of their Pilsner Urquell. You’ve probably heard of Pilsner beer–well Pilsner Urquell was the first type of beer of this kind (from Plzen, a city in CZ). It’s far above the traditional PBR and Budweiser you can get in America, and usually a large glass is a little over a dollar.

Maybe it was the whole “summer camp”-type setup but it brought out a side of me I’d almost forgotten. It’d been a long time since I’d seen my 8 year-old self, worn her shoes and laughed the way she laughed. And in doing so a lot of little fragments of that time surfaced and bobbed in my conscious. Like, memories from Girl Scouts camping trips - especially how to make a good s’more. Like, the Kookaburra song (apt because I am in Australia) that we learned for Small World Day in third grade. It was so hot on the island; Australian sun is really much harsher than East Coast US sun (sunscreen is a MUST!) but even when I was sweating like a pig, I still ran around playing cricket, hiking, swimming, kayaking. I didn’t care that I was tired and gross and tanned. The world was infinite fun and challenge, the way recess had been so long ago. It was like all the restrictions I’ve internalized of every passing year since fell away and all that was left was an openness to relish every moment. In time, the ridiculous shorts-tan I’ve achieved will fade or blend, but for now it’ll remind me to take a step back and see the world as an 8 year-old. </p><p>On Sunday, we explored a little more of Sydney on our own. I’ll write about that in another post but for now, first day of classes today. Wish me luck!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138435342905,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZnxdMt20xOx8v","DateString":"2016-01-31","Text":"<!-- more -->\n<a href=\"http://amyinthemaking.tumblr.com/post/137766038124/tips-for-a-semester-abroad\" target=\"_blank\">amyinthemaking</a>:\n<blockquote><h2>Tips for a Semester Abroad</h2>\n<p>As I prepare for another thrilling semester in Florence, Italy, I began thinking of all the items that I’m taking in my suitcase.

I’m in love. The city is beautiful. Everyday I wake up and feel like I’m in a Medieval movie! The architecture, which my Instagram followers are probably well aware of by now, is almost all gothic/romantic. I’m sure there is a better term for the style, but unfortunately, I haven’t taken an architecture tour yet. Soon, I promise!</p><p>The food here is one of my favorite things I’ve experienced so far. Beer culture is alive and well in this city. First and foremost, Czechs are proud of their Pilsner Urquell. You’ve probably heard of Pilsner beer&ndash;well Pilsner Urquell was the first type of beer of this kind (from Plzen, a city in CZ). It’s far above the traditional PBR and Budweiser you can get in America, and usually a large glass is a little over a dollar. Beer might not be cheaper than water here, but it’s damn close. </p><p>I’ve found that the Czech people are generally much quieter and more polite than the kind of people you’d find in America. The tram that I take everyday to get to the city center and my classes is quiet aside from a few whispered conversations. Usually it is us NYU students who make up the majority of the sound every morning. Furthermore, I’ve noticed that, while homelessness is a lot less obvious here as it is in New York, the poor people I’ve seen here are generally quieter and more respectful of your personal boundaries. I have yet to see a visibly homeless person on the trams, and the few that I have seen usually are silently bowing on the streets with their hands stretched in supplication. It’s odd to me as an American to see such resigned, dignified posture among the homeless. </p><p>Also, they don’t give plastic bags out for free in the stores here in Prague! It’s strange but also makes me so pleased! I always thought America was the center of environmental friendliness. Especially in my home town of San Jose, CA, I figured that the US led the way in terms of green technology (i.e. hybrid cars). However, it was only just recently that my city placed a plastic bag tax on stores. We haven’t even outright banned plastic bags&ndash;it’s still the default to have your items bagged this way. But in many stores I’ve been to in Prague, the cash register will not bag your items unless you specifically ask for a bag (which I think is called <i>tasku </i>in Czech). </p><p>I’m sure I’ll have more observations later, but these are the biggest things I’ve noticed so far. </p><p>&mdash;&ndash;</p><p>Anyway, on to the scary accident of the night: some friends and I were returning on the late night tram after a nice round of drinks at the Hemingway Bar (a touristy 20s themed bar with amazing cocktails). We just got on the tram we needed to take back to Osadni and were about a minute into the last leg of our tram ride home. </p><p>Now to preface the story: In Prague, trams here are aboveground and typically have the right of way because their mass makes it hard to slow down fast. So as a pedestrian, you have the right of way when it comes to crossing the street in front of a car, but you don’t have the right of way when it comes to trams. Same with other vehicles: cars must stop for trams. </p><p>Anyway, I was standing facing the front of the tram, looking over the back of my friend who had grabbed a seat in front of me. Honestly, I was slightly tipsy, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw a car come from the street that merged through the tram tracks. </p><p>It was as if everything had slowed down. In the back of my mind, I thought to myself, “That can’t be safe” when all of the sudden the tram and car collided! Luckily I was holding firmly onto a pole so I wasn’t thrown out of my seat or anything. I can say right now I escaped with no injuries, nor did my friends! </p><p>The tram driver emerged from his little driving compartment and muttered, “Debil” under his breath. Don’t ask me why, but I know this word means “asshole” in Czech. They didn’t teach me this in Czech class, just FYI. </p><p>A minute later, he got back on the tram. I was afraid he would rattle off a list of instructions in Czech to us and i wouldn’t be able to understand anything he said. Thankfully, the rest of the people on the tram seemed to start filing off, so my friends and I took this as our cue to get off and leave. We weren’t too far from Osandi by then, so we decided just to take the walk back on foot. </p><p>It was a strange way to end the night, and I’m grateful it looked like everyone on the tram and even the car’s driver were unharmed. It also makes me wonder about the traffic laws in Prague. I haven’t seen much “unsafe” driving, but I do remember my first reaction to hearing the right of way laws regarding trams my first day here was skepticism. There are very few stop signs and lights at intersections and merges here (at least compared to the US). While that means less traffic backup and a smoother ride overall, I can only guess what that means in terms of safe driving. </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138368583122,"NoteCount":55,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20tQGNI","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138361530906,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQlkHi20s-MeQ","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":"<p>It’s expensive but my dad wants me close to home.<br/><br/>I’ve been looking at studyblrs for a while and I can’t wait to buy my school supplies in August!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138352071799,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn20sRHHt","DateString":"2016-01-30","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/244249092&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/rachel-ag-gilman\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel A.G.

I go to New York University, but I feel like a lot of other collegiate libraries have similar features and therefore this might be of use to non NYU folk!</p><p>Basically, NYU’s Bobst library is seriously vast and connected. It is most likely that the book you are looking for has a place on the shelves. Start with a search on <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">BobCat</a> and select the filters “at Bobst” and “available” to see if that book is on the shelf right now for you to go and get. This was the case for about 20% of my textbooks. If you can’t find the book on the shelf and it says it’s available, a librarian can <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/forms/services/quick_search_request.html\" target=\"_blank\">do the search for you</a> (at a time when you aren’t counting down 15 min between classes)</p><p>The next line of defense is <a href=\"https://pds.library.nyu.edu/ezborrow\" target=\"_blank\">EZ-Borrow</a>, which is an expedited book-exchange system. EZ-Borrow keeps track of the availabilities in library catalogs in the tri-state area. I just ordered like 5 books to be at Bobst from Penn State and Rutgers. The book will arrive at Bobst in 3-5 days, so I stocked up on everything for the rest of the semester so I wouldn’t be caught without a text at the last minute. </p><p>Finally, there <a href=\"http://ill.library.nyu.edu/illiad/illiad.dll\" target=\"_blank\">ILL</a> (inter-library loan), aka We Will Get This Damn Book For U. ILL goes beyond just NYU/affiliated college libraries and sources from places like the NYPL. This is also how you get non-book materials to Bobst. ILL is also great for requesting *sections* of a book, so if you only need specific chapters, a librarian somewhere in the world will find them, beautifully scan them, and send them to Bobst. That way you don’t have to worry about a giant book <i>or</i> a due date. Yeah! (These materials also arrive in 3 to 5 days)</p><p>Both EZ-Borrow and ILL let you keep the book as long as if you’d checked it out from Bobst (12 weeks). </p><p>If all else fails, Bobst has an option where you can literally <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/forms/collections/recommend.html\" target=\"_blank\">put in a request</a> for a book you think they should have on their shelves. Of course that can’t guarantee they’ll buy it by the time you need to finish that research paper, but surely future generations will thank you. </p><p>I know a lot of this might seem obvious, but I have spent hundreds of dollars on textbooks for the past 7 semesters of college just because of the convenience and the thought that there’s really no better way. But after sitting down today and requesting all of my books from the library, I found just clicking “request” 50 times was easier than spending hundreds of dollars and eating halal food for dinner that night (lol). </p><p>Libraries are basically the shit and I definitely wish I’d taken advantage of these resources before it was my last semester of college!!</p><p>I hope this helps at least one person! &lt;3</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138175960279,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20hxTJN","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138175695001,"NoteCount":47,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z7S40v20hwSYP","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":"<p>Instagram: justgirlywishes</p><p>Twitter: wishespage</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":138169304996,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zn8DBi20hY4Ua","DateString":"2016-01-27","Text":"<p>The last 24 hours have been insane.</p><p><i><b>About 24 hours ago - 26 Jan 2016 11 PM</b></i></p><p>Ryosuke, Lina, Amanda, and I arrived at Urbanest Student Accommodation after sharing a cab from the airport (which cost about 20 AUS dollars each).

I landed in Frankfurt after an 11 hour flight that went pretty smoothly. There was little turbulence, and I spent the time reading <i>Ten</i> <i>Thousand Skies Above </i>by Claudia Gray and watching a few movies (<i>Julie and Julia, The Maze Runner: Scorch Trials, </i>and <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>). Unfortunately, due to jetlag, I couldn’t find it in me to sleep longer than a couple hours (something that would really bite me in the ass later). </p><p>After I landed in Frankfurt, I was solely focused on getting to my gate. The walk from the terminal our plane landed in to the next gate took forever! I was so surprised how large the airport was. The other thing that surprised me was the ease at which I passed through customs. There was a small border gate with a nonexistent line. The guard (who looked like a young Michael Fassbender *swoon*) barely looked at my passport, asked me pleasantly if I was going to Prague to study, and sent me on my way. It took all of 5 minutes. After that, I had to pass through another security checkpoint. This took a little longer, mostly due to my poor planning. 1) I hadn’t emptied my water bottle that I’d filled in San Francisco, so I had to chug the whole thing before passing through this next gate. 2) I didn’t take out my Kindle when I sent my backpack through the scanner. In the U.S., I never had any problems leaving my e-Readers in my backpack, so I was surprised when the guard got angry at me for leaving mine in my backpack. </p><p>After all the hassle at the security checkpoint, I found my gate about an hour and a half before boarding. I could already tell who was an NYU student and who wasn’t (mainly by who was young and speaking American English). Our plane got delayed for boarding by another 45 minutes due to inclement weather in Prague. </p><p>The flight to Prague was short &ndash; only 40 minutes in the air. It still hadn’t hit me yet that I was going to be living in a foreign country for the next 4 months! I was more concerned about finding my luggage and getting to the dorm in one piece. Luckily, after I landed, I was able to get both of my suitcases without any problems (#blessed) and found the NYU Prague staff waiting for us at the airport. There were a lot of us on the Frankfurt flight, and it was clear that we were all exhausted from our journeys. While waiting for the Prague shuttle, we all were gathered in a sort of miniature herd based on our dorms. It was mostly silent although there was some small talk that essentially served to keep us alert. </p><p>I almost fell asleep on the shuttle ride to my dorm, Osadni. The one thing I noticed was that the radio station playing in the shuttle played mostly American pop songs. I wonder if that’s because of Western media dominance in Central Europe or if the driver wanted to please our American music palettes.  </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137950606666,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6U2Ow20UVpLA","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<p>So awesome</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137947100127,"NoteCount":395,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zg8yww20UIRFV","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/a7e6dbcb2302cdbc2f02489cd99c55b0/tumblr_inline_o1gk06jZj41r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/18410a8c3635429c927cfb1ef7986e9e/tumblr_inline_o1gk0eTqJk1r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><p>&hellip;uh&hellip;thanks&hellip;?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137947054852,"NoteCount":100,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zg8yww20UIGC4","DateString":"2016-01-24","Text":"<figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/252442ea650ee75a1dd9bed48d72aa84/tumblr_inline_o1glso418X1r05wxm_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"300\" data-orig-width=\"450\"/></figure><p>It’s always great to meet people back from the DA days again through this wonderful fandom!

Then HKG to SYD. Then, the same coming back with a 1 hour layover at the end of the semester. I’d put off buying my tickets until only a month before my departure so I was looking for the best price that I could find. After hours of scouring the internet (<b>on Incognito mode</b>! - thanks Saemin and Erica), I found that usually, Google Flights is a good place to look for the best deal, but I ended up buying my roundtrip tickets from <a href=\"https://www.studentuniverse.com/flights?partner=newgate&amp;gclid=CP3p9MfTwMoCFdQYHwodWH8H9g\" target=\"_blank\">StudentUniverse</a>. Roundtrip tickets from Australia usually cost around $1,300 to $1,500 + tax and looking 2 to 3 months in advance will really help you in getting the best price.</p><h2>As far as luggage goes,</h2><p>I’m allowed two pieces of checked baggage that are 50 lbs. each - which I’d finished packing yesterday. According to one <a href=\"http://www.hercampus.com/life/travel/study-abroad-packing-musts-what-wear-study-abroad-different-countries\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>, I should pack like I’m heading to California. (Both places enjoy warm weather and an active lifestyle.) However, by the time I leave the only continent-nation in the world, it will be fall. Temperature highs in Australia in January average around high 80s. In May, they average mid 60s. So even though Australia alludes an eternal summer in imagination, I had to pack knowing that it will get a bit chilly toward the end of my stay.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width=\"3508\" data-orig-height=\"2556\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/f36a8eb5ab5c9d22a8da01d28b9e28d6/tumblr_inline_o1f6u8hsMu1qffdbv_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3508\" data-orig-height=\"2556\"/></figure><p>I also had to make sure that I didn’t pack too much because usually, I am either over-prepared or grossly under-prepared.

This week’s edition tackles division, isolation, and social relations.</em>\n</h1><p>The lament is familiar. The major political parties fail to attain\ncompromises and instead engage in demonizing each other.  Extremists and demagogues who indulge in\nvituperation sometimes seize them. The citizenry, and especially the young,\nfeel disaffected from the entire political process.  Observers attribute the current stalemate to\na host of vices: the corrupting influence of big money, the circus of the\nprimaries, the manipulation of voting districts, and the rise of social media,\nwhich divides rather than unites groups of potential voters.  </p>\n<p>This is probably all true, but it stays on\nthe surface level of politics and far away from our mundane concerns.  I suspect it mirrors what goes on underneath.\nThe term “gerrymandering” (named after a long forgotten governor\nof Massachusetts) means to divide a territorial unit into election districts to\ngive one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts\nwhile concentrating the voting strength of the opposition in as few districts\nas possible. But aren’t we doing the same in social relations, the very\nfabric of our daily lives?  I wish to\nsubmit to you the following paradox in our age of social media:  the more we stay connected with friends,\nacquaintances, and strangers, the more we isolate ourselves into gated virtual\ncommunities of like-minded people.  Connectivity\nleads to fragmentation. In social media life resembles a kaleidoscope of\nsolicitations, and we seek temporary refuge in fickle tribes, which are the\nelectronic districts of the similarly inclined.</p>\n<p> When we go beyond the fickle in search of the\nmore stable and steadfast we land in the domain of identity politics. But this\nmakes a bad situation worse. Communication does not improve. If and when these “tribes”\nhave to share a public domain, if they are to avoid a war of all against all,\nthey agree on a compact of mutual respect that goes under the rubrics of “diversity”\nand “tolerance.”  But at what price?  The upshot is often a reluctance to say\nanything that might offend somebody, and so the common language descends to the\nlevel of the anodyne. We have a surfeit of messages, but we are starved of conversation.  Certain names, books, topics and tropes are\nto be avoided in the name of a supposed harmony among those who do not really\nwish to engage each other in genuinely common pursuits.  This is especially perverse in the case of\ninstitutions of higher learning that once were proud of the title of liberal\narts.  For decades these bastions of\nacademic freedom protected the different and unpopular from the pressures of\noutside orthodoxy.  But recently many of\nthese former bastions want to protect insiders from each other, lest they make\neach other uncomfortable with opinions that are not a repetition of their own.  </p>\n<p>The guardians of the new orthodoxy are\nbureaucrats, not teachers.  Socrates no\nlonger roams the corridors making everybody uncomfortable with challenging\nquestions.  An army of professionals is\nreplacing the search for <em>veritas</em> by\nthe management of <em>in loco parentis</em>.  Since colleges are very expensive\nundertakings in an increasingly unequal and competitive world, and since they\nare run like a business, there is a natural tendency to please customers more\nthan to engage students.  As in the\nenclaves of Club Mediterranee, everything should be smooth, uncontroversial,\nand comfortable –at a hefty price.</p>\n<p>We risk moving from <em>collegium</em> to Club Ed. The old ideal was of colleges and universities\nhelping to think creatively and enrich the spiritual and intellectual life of\nfaculty and students.  The new model is\nreduced to a bunch of practical skills plus entertainment, with a supplement of\nthe therapeutic.  <em>Caveat emptor</em>:  Some daring instructor (soon to be suspended)\nmight assign <em>On Liberty</em> by John\nStuart Mill!</p>\n<p>Learn more about Professor Juan E Corradi <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%253A%252F%252Fsociology.as.nyu.edu%252Fobject%252Fjuancorradi.html&amp;t=N2VkZWE4OGM3YTA5YjA4MjkwMzhjYzljZTRjYzhkZGU5OGE5YTZlOCxibkFEMWZuYQ%253D%253D\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137801750586,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZEE-ii20LdzWw","DateString":"2016-01-22","Text":"<p>It’s the night before I leave for Prague, and I’m feeling a whole tornado of emotions. <br/></p><p>I’m nervous about living in a country where I can’t speak the language.

These items are comprised of things that can make my life in Italy just a little bit easier because they are things that I overlooked packing my first time around. Experience breeds wisdom &hellip; right? Anyway, here are my must-have items: <br/>\n-medicine <br/>\n      ~ this includes but is not limited to eye drops, cough drops, cold medicine, allergy medication, etc.<br/>\nThere are, of course, medicines in Italy, but I&rsquo;ve noticed that it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to be prepared with something that you trust to get rid of that unavoidable and  annoying cough or cold that creeps around at the beginning of the semester. <br/>\n-luggage locks<br/>\n      ~ yes this may be an item that you already use to secure your luggage but the trick is to bring extra locks for back packs (when staying in hostels or airbnbs to secure your belongings) or to have just in case one of your friends needs it.<br/>\n-phone plan<br/>\n      ~ let&rsquo;s face it, most of our communication takes place with our phones. I personally recommend either unlocking your phone before your departure if you know that you want to get a monthly plan when you arrive at your destination or asking your home provider if they have a plan that might work for you abroad. <br/>\n-money<br/>\n      ~this sounds like a no brainer but go into study abroad with a financial plan which includes your budget. Always have a plan B in case something goes wrong. I would not recommend money wiring, but I would highly suggest that you obtain some sort of bank account which someone back home also has access to because that way they can step in and help just in case something goes wrong.<br/>\n-personal hygiene care items<br/>\n      ~if you have a favorite toothpaste, deodorant, feminine care product, skincare item, etc you might want to bring it because chances are that you won&rsquo;t find that exact same product abroad. <br/>\n-positive mindset<br/>\n      ~ this is extremely important because you need to be open-minded in order to make the most of the incredible adventure that you are about to embark on. There will be ups and downs, but what matters the most is you learning and making the most of every experience that comes your way.</p>\n\n<p>Happy travels!<br/>\nUn bacio,<br/>\n-Amy</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137761429486,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZMxQ9y20JE9Vk","DateString":"2016-01-21","Text":"<p>People like Julia make the transient nature of our work difficult.

I’d written the script, assembled the crew, cast all the parts and now it was time to direct. On the first day of shooting I actually showed up to set early. Not on time - <i>early</i>. I wore sensible shoes with a small heel and I sat in the control room drinking coffee and going over the shot list as everyone else arrived and congregated around the craft table (food). </p><p>When it was time to roll camera I felt this surge rush through me like electricity. I’d never felt that kind of power in my life and - not gonna lie - I liked it. It did something for me. It did something <i>to</i> me.</p><p>Something like made me an asshole. Kind of.</p><p>Most directors have a reputation for being bullheaded and temperamental. I guess I had those moments over the years. But I wasn’t an asshole and it only happened when I was feeling particularly passionate about the project. That’s just the nature of being a director though. </p><p>But I remember walking to set at 721 Broadway for day 2 of shooting when I ran into <i>him</i>. This guy I’d had a massive crush on since freshman orientation 2 years prior. The first time I laid eyes on him he was singing in the Black Student Union office. I just about melted at the sound of his voice. It was the end of everything for me. He knew it too. He knew I wanted him. He did not return those feelings though he did mess with my head for five years, but I digress. </p><p>He intercepted me just as I was about to enter the building. We made small talk. I told him about my project. Or rather, I boasted about how awesome the project was going. For once, my mind was not on him and getting in his pants. I was thinking about my set, my crew, my actors. I was in director mode. I guess it came off as arrogant to this guy. Because he said so. He actually said I was being arrogant and I shouldn’t let this whole film business “go to my head.” </p><p>Instantly, a switch went off in my brain. </p><p>From that moment on I vowed I would not let the film business “go to my head.” Like a robot, my brain kept repeating that in my head over and over again until it stuck. Until I had it in my body. I went through the next couple of years of my career putting that into practice just in case he would see me in action again. Just in case I’d have the opportunity to show him I’d heeded his advice. Just in case it would make him love me. </p><p>Keep in mind I was 20. I was horny for this guy, I was young and most importantly, I was <i>dumb. </i>If anyone was to say something like this to me today I would spit in their face. Because I wasn’t being arrogant or a jerk or rude. I was simply distracted and excited about shooting my project,which I’d graciously taken the time to talk to him about despite my being in a hurry to get to set. He just didn’t like the fact that I wasn’t drooling all over him. </p><p>But of course I didn’t know that at the time. </p><p>At one point, sometime after graduating, this guy and I had a falling out and we haven’t spoken since. I don’t actively try to remember him or anything he ever said to me. In fact, most days I don’t think of him at all. But every once in awhile, I find myself checking in with myself. Asking the usual questions, “is there a kinder way I can phrase this? Am I coming across as arrogant? Will this upset someone if I say this? How can I shrink myself so that I seem humble and not intimidating?” </p><p>I try to stop those thoughts. To remind myself that I am a kind person and I don’t intentionally try to hurt others. But when I’m reminding myself of that fact that I see myself and I know who I am better than that guy or anyone ever did or ever will, I’m thinking about him and that moment outside of Tisch. </p><p>It’s funny what sticks with you no matter how hard you work to forget.</p><p>I know now that changing who I am won’t make someone love me. <i>He</i> will never love me. So I don’t need to replay that moment in my head ever again. I don’t need to hold on to that unsolicited, inappropriate and unnecessary piece of advice. </p><p>But one good thing came from that interaction. I’m always actively trying to practice kindness. Because as the saying goes, people may forget what you did and what you said but they’ll never forget how you made them feel. </p><p>I want people who work with me to always have a good feeling about me. If not love me.

NYU’s president, John Sexton, who will soon pass his position on to Andrew Hamilton, spoke a few words before the performance. He primarily praised NYUSH students for taking a “less conventional path” in their higher education.</p><p>“The theme of [the Reality Show] is, we’re here for each other,” said Sexton. “We just need you to know that there are other people out there that care about you. Maybe you’ll remember something that was said—or a song from the show.”</p><p>First written eleven years ago in New York City, this year’s Reality Show encompassed a wide range of topics relevant to any NYU student. Executed in several skits accompanied by songs and choreography, the show ultimately conveyed the message that NYU is, in fact, “here for you,” as Sexton said. No matter what problem an NYU student encounters –academic, health, social, or cultural– there is always hope and, as the show repeatedly points out, help can be found simply by calling the school’s Health and Wellness Center.  </p><p>The show also emphasizes that NYUSH is unlike any other college in the world because of its international community. One of the first musical skits –a piece about roommates– demonstrated that overcoming cultural barriers requires a willingness to embrace and understand one another’s differences. The show also included other relevant topics such as sexual consent, safe drinking, peer competition, fiscal responsibility, and body image.</p><p>The baseball skit threw the audience into uncontrollable laughter, as performers (Lilly Korinek, Oscar Fossum) educated a young student (Ben Weilun Zhang) about the rules of playing baseball, a euphemism for safe sex. “When you hit a home run, make sure that your glove’s on,” sang Fossum.</p><p>“So the whole point of baseball is getting a home run?” asked Ben Weilun Zhang.</p><p>“Well, getting a home run is great, but some people don’t get past first base for a long time. Just remember to have fun and respect the other team… Good luck, kid,” responded Korinek.</p><p>After a moment of silent confusion, Zhang responded: “Wait– these kids are talking about baseball? I’m just looking for a condom…” The comment resulted in thunderous laughter.</p><p>Another skit satirized the academic pressure that many NYU students feel on a daily basis, which is influenced by the competitive environment fostered by their peers. Defne Inhan, in a skit about peer competition, “created world peace.” “I created intergalactic peace,” shouted Cheryl Li in response. This type of competitive attitude is prevalent at many prestigious universities, and NYU is no exception.  Sometimes it can be overwhelming when everyone is talking about internships, company start-ups, and building resumes when one is simply trying to pass a certain class. “Don’t waste your energy trying to be better than others,” concluded Korinek in a public-service announcement, similar to the type that followed each performance.</p><p>The show lasted about two hours, and if laughter were bricks, the performance could have built the Great Wall of China. Still, a few skits illuminated the more serious aspects of college life, such as abusive relationships and drug use, which the audience met with respective and completive silence.  </p><p>“I thought the Reality Show was a very genuine portrayal of life in Shanghai both for students and people in general. I appreciated the honesty in which the performances presented themselves on stage, and as an audience member I felt engaged as well as touched by various moments throughout the show,” said Lou Demetroulakos ’19 when asked about the show.</p><p>Orsi Liddiard ’19 said: “I thought they approached the topics in a very relatable way, meaning that people could understand what was going in in the show, and while doing so, draw parallels between the show and their own lives at NYU Shanghai.”</p><p>The Reality Show not only educated the audience about relevant social topics, but also entertained. Ultimately, the Reality Show’s greatest accomplishment was the encapsulation of the enterprising spirit of NYUSH—diversity, inventiveness, ingenuousness, and fallibility. As Sexton said, “If it’s legal and moral do it once. Play another octave of the piano. Reach out to different people. That’s the vision of NYUSH and its global network.”</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137648280110,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20CUX8k","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Josh Fattal was one of three Americans detained by Iranian troops on July 31, 2009. He was hiking in Iraqi Kurdistan with friends Shane Bauer and Sarah Shourd when a border guard accused them of illegal entry into Iran. The three were later imprisoned and charged with spying. Fattal spent 781 days in an Iranian prison, 100 of those in solitary confinement. He was released on September 21, 2011. Josh Fattal is now a PhD candidate in NYU&rsquo;s history department, studying jurisdictional tensions, or how various forms of government (local, state, national) respond to similar issues. He lives in South Brooklyn with his partner, Jenny Borhman, and their son, Isaiah Azad Fattal. Azad means &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; in Farsi. Fattal, with Bauer and Shourd, is a co-author of the 2014 memoir &ldquo;A Sliver of Light: Three Americans Imprisoned in Iran.&rdquo;<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137643147311,"NoteCount":24,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv20CAy0l","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>NYU — home to people from all walks of life. Just by hanging around or talking to students on campus, you can get a feel for the NYU lifestyle pretty quickly. While we’re all a little different, we can’t help but notice some similarities among those we see and meet at NYU.<br/></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Born and Raised</h2><p>Their navigation of the subway is flawless and their sense of fashion sophisticated. Their excitement to be in the City for Welcome Week is barely noticeable compared to yours. Who are they? New Yorkers, and it’s easy to tell.</p><!-- more --><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Low-Key Celebrity</h2><p>They may not be famous themselves, but their phone full of A-listers might convince you otherwise. Their #tbt is a picture of them sitting on Martin Scorsese’s lap, and that late night Facebook check-in is tagged with Lorde. </p><p><br/></p><h2>The One Who LOVES New York City</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"412\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/d470d4a52c8f68b80e4c3891552c93f2/tumblr_inline_nr6tdy6s471ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Studying in New York is great — no doubt about that — and they make it well known. Well, at least their Instagram does. It’s an agglomeration of overfiltered pictures of the Manhattan skyline with lengthy captions about how the city has changed them. We’ll cut them some slack, because we totally get it.</p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Purple Bleeder</h2><p>They’ve been involved with student leadership before classes even started, attend all undergrad events, and have enough NYU swag to dress in purple for a couple weeks straight. We kinda admire their Violet pride, tbh.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Bobstworm</h2><p>You don’t know their names, you don’t know their years, but you know their faces. You always see them in that same spot at Bobst — studying, eating, or sleeping — whether it’s the first week of classes or the last day of finals. But if you always see them there, aren’t you a Bobstworm too?</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Incoming Transfer</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"208\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/07f98a0f14eb0e574bf635bfc440936a/tumblr_inline_nr6tfwTQ8v1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>You know you’re talking to a transfer student when you’re both juniors and they don’t know how to pronounce Bobst. But we’ll let that slide, because they made the smart choice to transfer from wherever they were before. </p><p><br/></p><h2>The Outgoing Transfer</h2><p>You should have seen it coming ; they had been wearing that Columbia sweatshirt for a while now.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Singer</h2><p>They bring Broadway to your bedroom. They play multiple instruments, practice their arpeggios every morning, and sing in the dining halls around their singer peers. They’re your enemy at 7AM on a Monday, and your best friend at karaoke at 1AM on a Saturday.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Student Film Director</h2><p>They collect tripods and camera lenses and are usually seen in Washington Square Park giving directions to a confused group of “actors.” They’re always on the lookout for “actors” such as you, humble student. Get ready.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Artsy One</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"440\" data-orig-height=\"205\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/60a4b932be806a49c83046cb8d86558e/tumblr_inline_nr6tl4rKnu1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>Studying a blend of social sciences and visual arts courses, they are always up-to-date on the latest happenings of the many underground worlds. Every social media platform they use is a collection of abstract art photographs captioned with elusive phrases that leave you confused. They’re just on a different level.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Vegetarian</h2><p>While their motives may vary, they all carefully monitor their diets and make sure everyone is aware of it. You sometimes wonder if they’re serious when asking for the vegetarian menu at Just Salad&hellip;?</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Business Student</h2><p>They’re often found walking in packs, wearing the business attire they received for Christmas with their computer briefcases in hand and business card ready. How do you know they go to business school? They’ll tell you.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Entrepreneur</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/c581fe461f71bd30f1252d420ee0e0f2/tumblr_inline_nr6uf7MeIl1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure><p>They try to attend as many networking events as possible, with the strong hope that their idea be the next <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/about/university-initiatives/entrepreneurship-at-nyu/inspire/success-stories/etsy.html\">Etsy</a>.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Greek Lifer</h2><p>Yes, it’s a thing here, despite our lack of frat houses and lawn parties. They move in packs and are actually some of the most tight knit communities at NYU.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The “Promoter”</h2><p>Usually a friend of a friend, they have enough contacts to guarantee you *free* and awesome* NYU rooftop parties almost every night of the year if you say their name.</p><p><br/></p><h2>The Freshman</h2><p>Lanyard.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137641502669,"NoteCount":9,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20C4gVD","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137638938423,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v20BwuSt","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137631705294,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_3Q5l20BVIZE","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Professor Cathcart discusses the Administration program with her new students. #nyucn #purplepride #instanyu #nyu  (at NYU Kimmel Center for University Life)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137627626917,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z72TWy20BFksb","DateString":"2016-01-19","Text":"<p>Lots of #purplepride today!

Sorry for not posting lately, but with the madness of finals and the holidays I haven’t really had much time to post. I will try to post more frequently in the new year! As I reflect on 2015, I can’t help but smile at all of the amazing memories and opportunities that I have been fortunate enough to have this year. I’ve definitely grown out of my shell and learned to explore things on my own. I’ve done things out of my comfort zone which has allowed me to pursue things that I’d never thought I’d be strong enough to do. I moved to Italy! Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that I would be as independent and adventurous as I am now. I am so incredibly grateful for all of my family and friends who have been supporting me and encouraging me to live life to the fullest. I’ve learned to take risks because sometimes those reap the greatest rewards. It’s good to get out of the “norm” once in awhile because that allows you to see what you are truly capable of. I’m so fortunate to be where I am today and be able to discover what the world has to offer. Finally, one of the  greatest things I have learned this year is  to surround myself with people who constantly encourage me to follow my dreams and empower me to aspire to be the best possible version of myself! I hope that everyone is doing well and I am extremely excited for what is to come! A presto!</p>\n<p>Un bacio,</p>\n<p>-A</p></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137373873285,"NoteCount":32,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-y7lI5","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137353934286,"NoteCount":20,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1-wxhNE","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137349828442,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZfcBCt1-wi0zQ","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137334147883,"NoteCount":7,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zzjwpw1-vmCih","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Holmes_Bobst_Library\">Bobst Library</a>, NYU.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137320672529,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJLCvx1-uyoqH","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>Guatemala #guatemala #medicaloutreach #volunteersaroundtheworld #medical #medicine #nyu #newyorkuniversity (at San Pedro La Laguna, Lago De Atitlán, Guatemala)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137320552792,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTQe7x1-uyLbO","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>Edgar Allen Poe&rsquo;s &ldquo;house&rdquo; in New York.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137319674300,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZtLU-v1-uu-6y","DateString":"2016-01-15","Text":"<p>@p.ekyi/instagram<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137303397232,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zd8MSx1-twvDm","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>🔯 | #Museum #NYU #NewYorkCity #EmpireStateOfMind #Magic #Occult #Art  (at 80WSE Gallery)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137303328152,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zd8MSx1-tweMO","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>Everyone should check out the NYU exhibit, The Language of Birds: Occult &amp; Art | #Occult #Art #Magic #NYU #NewYorkCity #EmpireStateOfMind #Museum  (at 80WSE Gallery)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137300806835,"NoteCount":7,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-tn0op","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":"<p>100 NYU students, faculty and alumni wrote, directed, shot, produced or performed in movies at this year&rsquo;s Sundance Film Festival: <b><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1n64rt2\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1n64rt2</a></b></p><p>Photo by Jemal Countess / Courtesy of Sundance Institute<br/><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137296671697,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTrMkq1-tXFFH","DateString":"2016-01-14","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":137244355004,"NoteCount":95,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z_i3zj1-qPgcy","DateString":"2016-01-13","Text":"<p>In this shot I couldn’t really choose which colors to take, so I took both.

Cause that’s kind of what I’ve been doing :)<br/></p><p>So I just finished my third semester, and classes are definitely getting more challenging.</p><p>I accomplished my goal of writing more comedy, and I think my confidence is slightly raising in that field! Which is great because that’s literally what I want to do for a career and I have to stop being so intimidated by it. I was writing more because I had to for some comedy classes I was in, so I’m hoping my motivation doesn’t go away next semester! </p><p>For those that don’t know, I’m concentrating in “political satire” in Gallatin, so I basically want to write and produce comedy for TV. Last semester I took 2 comedy classes, which really helped me focus on what I want to do. I’m taking fewer comedy-centric classes next semester, but I’m taking more classes to expand my concentration and studies as a whole. Here’s the breakdown:</p><p>1 TV writing class, in which I’m going to write a script for a half-hour comedy!<br/>1 class that’s technically about politics (”Politics” is in the title, but I’m taking this class mostly to satisfy 3 different requirements!!!)<br/>1 Producing class for my producing minor, I think I’m also writing a TV script in this class, not too sure&hellip;<br/>1 film class that’s a prereq for a comedy study abroad program I’m applying for! The study abroad program is literally called “Comedy Writing and Production for Television,” so I’m realllllllly excited about it :)<br/>And I’m taking a 2 credit course that I created about Political Satire in Late Night!!! We’ll be analyzing how shows like The Daily Show or the Colbert Report affect political activism and participation. This class is really going to help fine-tune my concentration!</p><p>I also switched advisors and the switch will be taking effect this semester! My new advisor is also conveniently teaching that TV writing class, and he teaches a lot of comedy writing, so I’m excited to learn a lot from him.<br/></p><p>Overall, my studies are really pointing me in the direction that I want to go in, but I’m pretty clueless in the internship area. I need to get an internship somehow related to comedy, but the deadline to intern for most TV networks was months ago. Hopefully I can find an internship I’m passionate about!</p><p>I just realized this entire post was about my academics and not much about my actual life at NYU&hellip; I guess that’s just where my focus is! </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642578216,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GY4Se","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Washed </i>by Rikke Louis Schjoedt</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642476856,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GXhiu","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Washed</i> by Rikke Louis Schjoedt</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136642418761,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z10Onk1-GXTX9","DateString":"2016-01-05","Text":"<p><i>Ookie Cookie </i>by Francesca Mirabella</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136636815626,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-GC5aA","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136636484434,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z8ck6r1-GAqjI","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":"<p>🙂 back 2 school 🙃</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136635759829,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZtN4ux1-G83pL","DateString":"2016-01-04","Text":"<p>Are you a student at New York University (NYU)?

It was brutal.\nI never thought it would be because I came to New York to attend a two-year\nacting conservatory. I didn’t mind working odd jobs when I first started out of\nthe gate. I was all about “paying my dues”. But as the years stacked, my “dues”\nweren’t moving me in the direction I had hoped. I soon realized I didn’t have\nmuch to offer the working world. I had zero office skills. Without a degree, I was\nmet with many closed doors of potential opportunities at media companies that\nmight have offered a new perspective on life.</p><p>I grew envious\nand felt inferior to my peers who had completed their education. They appeared stronger\nat problem solving and critical thinking than I was. I was always searching for\nways to make myself feel whole while I pursued acting. I challenged myself with\nsituations that were not in my comfort zone, I traveled solo to Europe and\nAsia, I took tons of classes, attended various lectures and museum exhibits,\nbut in my mind I was always coming up short and didn’t know how to catch up. </p><p>For years going\nback to school was never an option that was on the table because I saw it as\ngiving up on my passion to be the actress that brought me to New York in the\nfirst place.</p><p>Passing on learning\nin the classroom for 30 + courses came back to haunt me years later. It also\nmeant I passed on all the programs that colleges offered to help develop\nstudents in myriad ways. I missed the opportunities to try new things in a safe\nenvironment, creating passion projects without being certain how, and hosting\nevents within school clubs. </p><p>College\ncreates a protected space to not know, fail, and build upon those lessons all\nin preparation to enter the world as a well-rounded individual. When you are\nout in the world, you are expected to know fundamental skills. You aren’t\nequipped with an overstocked supply of highly credible potential mentors at\nyour fingertips willing to help you navigate life the way you do when you are\nin a college or university setting.</p><p>Perhaps if there\nisn’t a solution to offer students an affordable higher education, the shift\nneeds to happen within the pressure society places on students to finish within\na four-year period. Perhaps we need to create more programs where students can\nwork full time to offset the debt. Perhaps we as a society need to encourage\nstudents to attend school at their own pace. </p><p>I think higher\neducation is invaluable and a necessity that needs to be fought for with great\nvigilance to ensure it happens for each one of us.  I don&rsquo;t think the question should be if students\nshould attend college; I think the question should be how we can restructure\ncollege to fit into the new mold into which our society is developing.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136560674866,"NoteCount":16,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZFnX5y1-BfeWo","DateString":"2016-01-03","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":136553839102,"NoteCount":12,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1-BFZd_","DateString":"2016-01-03","Text":"<p>How many things can you do in one day just using an NYU ID?

Some people work or find internships. I guess this leads into your next question: <b>How hard is it to make friends/socialize with other students?</b> Some people find it pretty hard. Because the thing with NYU is that you are living in a city. There’s a whole lot of independence there and everyone is sort of doing their own thing. BUT. You still have all of your classes and there are the clubs I already mentioned. But for me, it was super easy. All thanks to study abroad. I spent my freshman year in London, then went right on to Florence. I actually just came back from another semester in London. Study abroad is a great chance to meet friends- there are less people and you are thrown into an environment where you can constantly go on trips or explore. It’s wonderful. *that doesn’t mean that studying abroad is perfect, mind you. it can be quite difficult being away from your security net and that is totally normal*</p><p><b>Is it a safe environment?</b> Oh yeah.

After spending a few days in Istanbul, I will travel to Prague and spend a few more with family before heading off to Paris. For the next nine months, I will call Paris my home as I spend my first year at NYU studying in France.</p>\n<p>Receiving my acceptance letter in March, my interest was piqued by the notion that I could spend my first year abroad. To be completely honest, NYU was one of my safety schools during the college application process. But after thoughtful consideration about who I am and the person I want to be, I decided to take the leap into New York City and (what I hope will be) the greatest experience of my life thus far. Studying abroad in Paris was definitely a major factor in my choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"denied:%E2%80%9Dhttp://www.frommadison.com/packing-for-a-year-of-study-abroad/%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">Read more.</a>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":135338831685,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZmIQzt1_2qgz5","DateString":"2015-12-16","Text":"<p>Dec. 12 - Another amazing collaboration with #johnshopkins #cty and #nyu at the Pathways to College event #admissions #latergram</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":135336403932,"NoteCount":4,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZLMEdo1_2hQFS","DateString":"2015-12-16","Text":"<p>My best friend got into her top school and everybody should go congratulate <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mnMyICy4ycw3iyXicuWbu8g\" target=\"_blank\">@bby-gal</a> for being amazing.

People say that in college you grow up quickly and change incredibly, but I didn’t necessarily find that the case. Rather, I felt that my perception of the world changed radically. The fall of 2015 wasn’t exactly a cake walk for the rest of the world. Between mass shooting, discrimination, terrorism, and a litany of various other atrocities, the world stood watching, waiting, and saying what they felt. As I dived into my first semester of higher education during such a point in history, I couldn’t hep but feel the tumultuousness of the times. Yet, as a quiet observer of such events, I realized how alike everyone was. We all act attempting for the well-being of the world. Every person goes about this in different ways, but we really all want the same thing. As this unsettling and dangerous year comes to an end, nevertheless opening another year to bear similar surprise, it would do us all well to look at the world in a broader context and know that we’re all doing different things to achieve the same ends.

This being said, the performers who made the biggest impact on\nme were not these Grammy-winning artists and songwriters, but the members of\nthe various New York-based organizations showcased, including the Stuttering\nAssociation for the Young and the New York Freedom Choir, which accompanied\nsome of the other performers for Happy Xmas (War is Over) and Power to the\nPeople, respectively. These choirs demonstrated the strength and the love that\nJohn Lennon encouraged and showed just how powerful his legacy is. He would\nhave been overjoyed to hear these amazing voices sing the songs that meant so\nmuch to him. This program was so special and it is something that I will\ncontinue to reflect on and remember throughout my life.

And I don’t know how to generally explain it. So I’ll just talk about how this came to be for this particular reason.</p><p>I’m currently writing a story where one of my characters attends NYU. Being that I have never been on an NYU campus, I needed to see what a typical NYU dorm may look like. Low and behold, they’re all bloody different depending on the building &amp; neighborhood, but that’s good ‘ol Manhattan for you.</p><p>So I searched on youtube and I watched one video with two girls and the next with a guy who is seemingly a pro skater. His video was more quirky &amp; humorous and I thoroughly enjoyed it. His roommate James was filming the video and he introduced him briefly. I don’t know what it was about James but I was interested. I always felt that NYU students had more going on about them than any other college. It’s NYC, everyone is artsy in some form. I wanted to know more about James lol. So I found out he’s a film student&hellip;that was a plus. Not to mention he had a rad hairdo &amp; facial scruff going on&hellip;another plus. By now I feel like a stalker but who cares, he’s interesting and I found his Vimeo account because (1) he’s a film student, of COURSE he’s gonna be on Vimeo and (2) I wanted to check out his filming style considering I’ll be going back to college soon as a film major (hopefully, still waiting to see). Anyway&hellip;</p><p>I guess the overall bottom line is that I notice the people in the background. I stumble upon people and I see what their friends are about because, despite how much I might be against the whole liking-human-beings type of thing, I know there are some very interesting people walking this earth. You know, the type that do NOT deserve to be put on an island with no food. Awesome people still exist! So&hellip;that’s a thing I do once in a blue moon. It’s fun. It’s like how people watch a youtube video and 2 hours later, they’re watching a cat fight a laser.</p><p>Anyhoo&hellip;I thought I’d share one of James’s videos in an upcoming post. We may not know each other, James, but I hope you get far in life or wherever your heart desires.</p><p>x</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134709991908,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZSj_gj1zTLrda","DateString":"2015-12-07","Text":"<p>Foxy Roxy!

During the day, it’s a lively ecosystem with an ever-changing cast of characters studying for an hour or two before heading to their next location. But at night, it changes. Into the wee hours of the night, no one is at Bobst just to pass the time, they&rsquo;re there to work… or at least pretend to work. Here are the NYU students you inevitably will see in Bobst… at night.</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/99aab6a7cac815e3b10bfdd5173e436d/tumblr_inline_nxxgvlXvcx1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"480\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure><!-- more --><br/><h2>The Sleeper</h2><p>Whether they’re snuggled up in a comfy chair they’ve managed to claim or hunched over a desk, this person can be found on any floor of Bobst on any day of the year. We get it though, it’s been a long day.</p><br/><h2>The Insomniac</h2><p>This person has obviously been awake for 24+ hours. Their unblinking eyes have overcome the heaviness of exhaustion and just vowed to stay open for the rest of eternity. Most commonly seen during exam season. </p>\n<br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/1ce2c69d92fb0b09880467ca4f5d680c/tumblr_inline_nywkgth8xS1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"282\"/></figure><br/><h2>The Texter</h2><p>This person has been on their phone for two hours straight! Who are you texting so furiously right now? Hopefully a study partner?</p><br/><h2>The Disappearing Act</h2><p>Their stuff has been taking up a cubicle space all night, yet they are nowhere to be found. Did they get lost on the way to the printer? Did they swing by home to grab dinner? Did they never really exist at all? We’ll never know&hellip;</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/463c7d6ea57fc26b7c59c48ec17efc6c/tumblr_inline_nywkhiVBKK1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><br/><h2>The Casual Diner</h2><p>We didn’t think it could be done but this person managed to bring a full five-course meal into the confines of Bobst. Not only have they enjoyed it all at their study spot, they also have a array of snacks set aside for pre- and post-meal consumption. Hey, wanna share?</p><br/><h2>The Social Butterfly</h2><p>It’s a misconception that Bobst is eerily quiet at night. It’s actually quite loud thanks to this person. They REALLY need to explain to the people around them how stressed they are for their essay due in four days. Shhhhhh!</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"234\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/7712d0c0428be15b3c2e078aacf19d96/tumblr_inline_nywkjpB2t11ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"234\"/></figure><br/><h2>The Speaker System</h2><p>We get it. Hotline Bling is a total jam… buuuuuuuut we REALLY need you to turn your music down.</p><br/><h2>The Resident</h2><p>For this person, Move-In Day wasn’t in August, it was on the day they decided that they might as well just stay in Bobst.

We can’t sure&hellip; What we do know is that they’ve been watching films and shows on their computer screen since they’ve sat down. What are they really in Bobst for? The WiFi?</p><br/><h2>The Ideal Studier</h2><p>No quirks or distracting habits. Just quietly studying for their upcoming test or writing a paper they put off for a little too long.

Beginning with \nAleister Crowley’s tarot paintings and Austin Osman Spare’s automatic \ndrawings of the 1920s, the exhibition traces nearly a century of occult \nart, including Leonora Carrington and Kurt Seligmann’s surrealist \nexplorations, Kenneth Anger and Ira Cohen’s ritualistic experiments in \nfilm and photography, and the mystical probings of contemporary \nvisionaries such as Francesco Clemente, Kiki Smith, Paul Laffoley, \nBREYER P-ORRIDGE, and Carol Bove.</p><p>The concerns and influences of \neach of these artists are as eclectic as the styles in which they work. \nWhile several of the pieces deal with “high” or ceremonial magic, others\n draw from so-called “low magic” practices and have deeply chthonic \nroots. The approaches in technique are varying as well, with some doing \nyears of research and preparation for the act of creation, and others \nworking entirely intuitively. Regardless of method, Language of the Birds\n suggests that all are part of the same lineage: one that pulls on \nthreads from the esoteric web of alchemy, Hermeticism, Spiritualism, \nTheosophy, divination and witchcraft.</p><p>The exhibition takes its \nname from the historical and cross-cultural notion that there is a magic\n language via which only the initiated can communicate.  Often referred \nto as the “language of the birds,” it is a system rumored to operate in \nsymbols, and to be a vehicle for revealing hidden truths and igniting \nmetamorphic sparks.</p><p>The artists in Language of the Birds \ncan be considered magicians, then, when seen through this mythopoeic \nlens. A visual vocabulary is offered up by them, so that we all might be\n initiated into their imaginal mystery cults and dialog with the \nineffable. They speak to us in secret tongues, cast spells, and employ \npictures for the purpose of activating profound change in both \nthemselves and in us.  By going within, then drawing streams of imagery \nforth through their creations, each of these artists seeks to render the\n invisible visible, to materialize the immaterial, and to tell us that \nwe, too, can enter numinous realms.</p><p><b>Participating Artists</b></p><p>Kenneth\n Anger * Anohni (FKA Antony Hegarty) * Laura Battle * Jordan Belson * \nAlison Blickle * Carol Bove * Jesse Bransford * BREYER P-ORRIDGE * John \nBrill * Robert Buratti * Elijah Burgher * Cameron * Leonora Carrington *\n Francesco Clemente * Ira Cohen * Brian Cotnoir * Aleister Crowley * \nEnrico Donati * El Gato Chimney * Leonor Fini * JFC Fuller * Helen \nRebekah Garber * Rik Garrett * Delia Gonzalez * Jonah Groeneboer * \nJuanita Guccione * Brion Gysin * Frank Haines * Barry William Hale * \nValerie Hammond * Ken Henson * Bernard Hoffman * Nino Japaridze * Gerome\n Kamrowski * Leo Kenney * Paul Laffoley * Adela Leibowitz * Darcilio \nLima * Angus MacLise * Ann McCoy * Rithika Merchant * William Mortensen *\n Rosaleen Norton * Micki Pellerano * Ryan M Pfeiffer &amp; Rebecca Walz *\n Max Razdow * Ron Regé, Jr. * Kurt Seligmann * Harry Smith * Kiki Smith *\n Xul Solar * Austin Osman Spare * Charles Stein * Shannon Taggart * \nGordon Terry * Scott Treleaven * Panos Tsagaris * Charmion von Wiegand *\n Robert Wang * Peter Lamborn Wilson * Lionel Ziprin</p><p><b>Special Events Related to the Exhibition</b></p><p>Weds, Jan 13: Opening Reception   6-8pm</p><p>Weds, Jan 27: Performance of “The Language,” a theatrical piece written by playwright Matthew Freeman, commissioned for Language of the Birds    7pm</p><p>Fri, Feb 5 – Sun, Feb 7: <a href=\"http://www.phantasmaphile.com/occult-humanities/\">The Occult Humanities Conference</a>\n at NYU Steinhardt – a weekend long symposium of 14 lectures and \nperformances which explore the influence of magical thought upon art, \nhistory, and contemporary culture</p><p>Weds, Feb 10: “Art Workings” Lectures and panel discussion with Professor Susan L.

You wonder how they will ever get a job.</p>\n\n<p>Cancer: That kid who is falling apart at the seams, constantly complaining about the trials and tribulations of living in New York.

Goes to exhibits and shows all the time, mostly for the cool Instagram pics.

Likes thrift shopping, dropping the term “heteronormativity,” and interpretive dance.</p>\n\n<p>Pisces: That kid who makes their own clothes and drew their own sick tattoo. You catch them Photoshopping masterful works of art in lecture, on their MacBook Air. Probably does slam poetry on the weekends.

Most of the time, you wave and they pretend to not see. Then the two of you go on with your lives, easy peasy. But here at NYU, it’s a little different. There are SO many of us in a particular area at one time that run-ins happen practically every hour. Since no one likes an awkward moment, learn the ins and outs of turning that awkward encounter into an awesome one. <br/></p><br/><h2>Laundry Room </h2><a href=\"http://dontbematerialistic.tumblr.com/post/56164983908\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/6869aadb0bb17c8158495d522604c564/tumblr_mqbgbaTHyZ1rx9n8ho1_400.gif\" width=\"500\" alt=\"image\"/><figure></figure></a><p>\tSometimes the perfect time to do your laundry lines up with that floormate you sort of know but whose name escapes you. Pro Tip: Just bite the bullet and ask them their name! Another friend in your building means another person for Netflix-binging nights. </p><!-- more --><br/><h2>Residence Hall  </h2><a href=\"http://dormtrends.tumblr.com/post/95620092900/finally\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/a6dda19387c26bda28b62732a04aa379/tumblr_nanryx1igK1rz4wo0o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tGetting to know your roommates at first can be a little tricky, especially when one is up until 4AM and the other wakes up at 5AM. Pro Tip: Arrange for a roommate “family” dinner. It gives you an opportunity to talk about what’s going on in your room while also eating. It’s the best of both worlds. </p><br/><h2>Dining Hall </h2><a href=\"http://malabellum.tumblr.com/post/92272095737\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/3afc002bcc21730fe008bb2116326318/tumblr_n8yy0euJ3b1t1udzmo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\"/></a><p>\tStuffing your face in the dining hall is a sight that only a select few of your friends have been approved to see. But at this point in college, people don’t even think twice about seeing other people eat to their heart’s content. Pro Tip: Always try to keep an open chair at your table. After all, what’s a better bonding activity than face-stuffing Palladium brunch?</p><br/><h2>Starbucks </h2><a href=\"http://fiercegifs.tumblr.com/post/99908994025\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/378667dd1a6883801522f0f03f0db1b6/tumblr_nde1p5Pjqm1rfduvxo1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tCoffee is the answer to everything, except for when you run into someone you haven’t seen since Welcome Week at the campus Starbucks. Pro Tip: Say hello and bring up something you saw them post on Facebook or Instagram. Conversation started! </p><br/><h2>Bars </h2><a href=\"http://howimetyourmotherguys.tumblr.com/post/54345725521\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/c189b46f74f7c505634aad338c75e0e9/tumblr_mp9j71Trrv1s5ewi4o1_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tWhen will the awkward encounters end? Never. Because that’s life. But it’s not always awful. Seeing a professor at bar may seem like the end of the world, but it gives you an opportunity to see what they are like outside of the classroom. Pro Tip: Rather than avoiding eye contact, greet them like the grown-up that you are! </p><br/><h2>Subway </h2><a href=\"http://britneyaddiction.tumblr.com/post/87567334309/this-is-perfectly-normal-x\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/dd8eec8981350071fe6ee1b565515299/tumblr_n6iy0x4fiN1qd8zg3o1_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>Seeing someone you know on the platform may seem like a damper on that majestic feeling of independence, but it really gives an opportunity to test your quick conversation skills. Pro Tip: Put the headphones away. Listening to “Uptown Funk” for the 10,000th time can wait 20 more minutes. </p><br/><h2>Bobst</h2><a href=\"http://zzyzzyx.tumblr.com/post/22124043713/ldr-dancing-in-the-library-you-know\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m3asi7JoXr1qa2wqmo1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tWhen studying needs to be done, the library is always a good place for some peace and quiet. You didn’t take the hike to Bobst to have a conversation about the latest episode of “Orange is the New Black,” but the person sharing your desk might believe that you did. Pro Tip: Tell them that you have to study at the moment, but you’d love to catch up during a coffee break. </p><br/><h2>The Classroom</h2><a href=\"http://thevoodoothatyoudowoo.tumblr.com/post/43418657443\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/57152d3b3277441138cc0e2293edc6bb/tumblr_mi2364jtuH1qbn5f7o1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></a><p>\tTalking to people in class can be inexplicably hard. You’re both there for the same reason, yet finding a connection to a classmate is like tapping your head and rubbing your belly at the same time: difficult, but not impossible. Pro Tip: If nothing comes to mind, ask a question about the syllabus or next week’s reading. </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134469744746,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZDIpJt1zF1NXg","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p><b>Don’t:</b> Send the same cover letter to every position</p><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"195\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/8498c6ffb12c3a5d68dc5e43d85c85d0/tumblr_inline_nxwyilceM91rdz1kf_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"195\"/></figure><p><b>Do:</b> Specialize the cover letter to the job description</p><p><b>Don’t:</b> List out your skill sets</p><figure data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"254\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"fatamy-rebelwilson:z44cJ8KwLy3J2XdTg25xgw:ZfJhxtVv1ZYD\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcdguuLEk21rjb8e7o1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-height=\"254\"/></figure><p><b>Do:</b> Describe examples showing the things you have learned in your past experience<br/></p><p><b>Don’t:</b> Talk about how this will benefit your career goals</p><figure data-orig-width=\"289\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/dd8eddd0fde629e10a1f43cefbe376e7/tumblr_inline_ny0rh9H5dU1rdz1kf_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"289\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><b>Do:</b> Talk about what the company will gain from having you on board</p><p><b>Don’t:</b> Write a novel</p><figure data-orig-width=\"346\" data-orig-height=\"251\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"melhoresgifsdomundo:TWQL4qxYDZA4FbCfB29y8A:ZS1Ves1AcJzxx\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/a212a2e7d79cb845cebed1c809b97cf9/tumblr_n2pcxnAfG31s9ab4to1_400.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"346\" data-orig-height=\"251\"/></figure><p><b>Do:</b> Be specific &amp; concise, taking up about &frac34; of the page<br/></p><p><b>Don’t:</b> Forget to thank them</p><figure data-orig-width=\"272\" data-orig-height=\"200\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/017291eea6e1250ece82bdd622491431/tumblr_inline_nxx0m8UxrF1rdz1kf_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"272\" data-orig-height=\"200\"/></figure><p><b>Do: </b>Use the last paragraph to thank the employer for their consideration &amp; talk about an interview</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134465392667,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZLVM2t1zEmn0R","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p>The cutest shoes 🌸</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134445787417,"NoteCount":53,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZA2wmm1zDb_aP","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p>Christy Turlington in Washington Square Park, by Pamela Hanson</p><p>Taken while she was studying at NYU in 1997 </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134445038196,"NoteCount":153,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zz-WTv1zDZ7fq","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p>Christy Turlington by Pamela Hanson for Esquire Mag, 1997</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134438659277,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZHEJUk1zDAoJD","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134435438502,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZEA3dn1zC_V_c","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.metalnerd.net/veil-of-maya-debut-nyuleeloo-live-video/\">Veil Of Maya debut &ldquo;Nyu&rdquo;/&ldquo;Leeloo&rdquo; live video</a></strong></p>\n\n<p>Veil Of Maya have released a live video for their tracks &ldquo;Nyu&rdquo; and &ldquo;Leeloo&rdquo; during a show in Helsinki, Finland.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":134429328360,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJxG_t1zCdCFe","DateString":"2015-12-03","Text":"<p>Great photos from AIB alum Barbara Edelstein&rsquo;s collaboration with Jian-Jun Zhang at the Long Museum in Shanghai!</p><p>via: <a href=\"http://shanghai.nyu.edu/photos/students-collaborate\" target=\"_blank\">http://shanghai.nyu.edu/photos/students-collaborate</a></p><p>Barbara Edelstein exhibited her work with Art in Buildings in 2005 and 2012.

Waking up early means experiencing a whole new population of the city</h2><a href=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/9e72ad1b5338d8f71d7caa10f3e73c7f/tumblr_inline_no32tdZljI1ro0zrp_500.gif\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/9e72ad1b5338d8f71d7caa10f3e73c7f/tumblr_inline_no32tdZljI1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure></a><p>In every city there are certain types of people you see in the morning. For instance, old people doing tai chi in Shanghai and dog walkers in New York all seem to congregate in these early hours. None of that phases you anymore on your walk to your early class, though!</p><br/><h2>4. Tourist spots are a no-go</h2><a href=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/e55c2452ba2360a759512370c2ff3fe1/tumblr_inline_no342dwwEV1ro0zrp_500.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/e55c2452ba2360a759512370c2ff3fe1/tumblr_inline_no342dwwEV1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure></a><p>If you find yourself in a place like Times Square, you are probably not there for scenic pleasure. All around the world locals avoid tourist spots like the plague. One time up the Pearl Tower in Shanghai is more than enough; next time you go to the Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi will be when family is visiting.</p><br/><h2>5. You have a restaurant on call for any type of food</h2><a href=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/cc4d12ff8b1c7eebeab1f76a31f9e713/tumblr_inline_no34e6iMuA1ro0zrp_500.gif\"><figure class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/cc4d12ff8b1c7eebeab1f76a31f9e713/tumblr_inline_no34e6iMuA1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" width=\"500\"/></figure></a><p>One of the most awesome things about living in a big city is the even larger food choices!

Whether it’s your first NYC winter or not, you can never be too prepared for the first snowfall and temperature drops. Fortunately, we’ve braved a few winters ourselves and have a few handy tips to help keep your tush warm and toasty. (Unless you’re still <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/131297267206/signs-you-arent-ready-for-the-cold-weather-at-nyu\">in denial about the impending cold</a>, then we can’t do much to help you out with this one.)</p>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/YBBMJQ\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/03fac63794c6a503079bcbb467d76a8c/tumblr_inline_nxckkcfeHq1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure></a><h2><br/></h2><!-- more -->\n\n<h2>1. Buy a warm winter coat</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1fyQueu\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"283\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/f891ea0b29a7fbc8ceeb77011a8ed371/tumblr_inline_nxckkkuF7y1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"283\"/></figure></a><p>That everyday wool cardigan and oh-so SoHo leather jacket are style staples, but nothing will cut the cold like a nice fleece or parka. Layer your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nyubook.collegestoreonline.com/ePOS?this_category=11&amp;store=209&amp;listtype=begin&amp;form=shared3%2fgm%2fmain%2ehtml&amp;design=209\">fave NYU sweater</a> and thermals underneath, and you’re golden! Style and comfortability CAN go hand-in-hand, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/hashtagnyu/nyu-street-style/\">NYU students</a> know it all too well.</p>\n<br/><h2>2. Avoid those iced coffees</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1kdZyEY\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"332\"><img src=\"http://i.giphy.com/SKjrGSWO9WTxC.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"332\"/></figure></a><p>As necessary as they are (and as much as they’ve become a habit) to your morning routine, those iced coffees might do more harm than help. Not only is sipping on an iced beverage just a quick way to get you cold on the inside, your hands — mittens or not — will FREEZE holding your drink. Opt for that toasty dark roast or hot cocoa instead (your fingers and body will thank you).</p>\n<br/><h2>3. Accessorize with gloves and headwear</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/b0341e21d572da95c41a852c32633fc6/tumblr_nrva5a74Bo1u8b7efo2_250.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"367\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/b0341e21d572da95c41a852c32633fc6/tumblr_inline_nxxgtq74xU1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"367\"/></figure></a><p>Whether you’re holding your Starbucks in hand or not, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nyubook.collegestoreonline.com/ePOS?store=209&amp;search_category=Front+Page&amp;listtype=begin&amp;index=0&amp;form=shared3%2Fsearch%2Fsearch_results.html&amp;design=209&amp;KEY=gloves&amp;keytype=sku&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\">wearing gloves</a> can never hurt. Freezing fingers means slower texting, so keep them warm to make sure your emoji game stays strong. Likewise, your ears need some lovin’ too. Put on a pair of earmuffs or a hat when the temperature drops, so you don’t accidentally pull a van Gogh. (Being a genius like him would be nice, but so is having ears.)</p>\n<br/><h2>4. Use window blinds wisely</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/enhanced/webdr05/2013/8/19/12/anigif_enhanced-buzz-23329-1376928881-8.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/ea6a7044a55d17a6d5edb7047bd5c280/tumblr_inline_nxxgx9tZU31ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure></a><p>In the words of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://imagesmtv-a.akamaihd.net/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:mtv.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/High-School-Musical-2-Piano-1436973522.gif\">Sharpay Evans in High School Musical 2</a>:“It’s out with the cold, and in with the new. Goodbye clouds of grey; hello skies of blue.” Ok&hellip; Maybe she didn’t say “cold,” but you get the idea. Keep your room cozy by opening the blinds during the day to let in the sunlight (aka HEAT!) and close them at night to seal the warmth indoors. If you can manage that, you’ll never want to leave your warm apartment — especially since Netflix and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tapingo.com/order/campus/new-york-university/delivery/\">Tapingo delivery</a> are a thing.</p>\n<br/><h2>5. Carry an umbrella</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1b5KSCQ\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/9ed270225f9e68fc2c3684584e141d36/tumblr_inline_nxckm0QfCJ1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\"/></figure></a><p>Even if your weather app reads a pretty low chance of rain or snow, pack that umbrella anyway. That winter coat will definitely keep you warm, but get it too wet and it’s game over! Plus, snow-dusted hair is generally not a nice look.</p>\n<br/><h2>6. Keep it moving</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://media.giphy.com/media/K64BPl9iONCGA/giphy.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"359\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/d6cd74e8adbae9d54c549d174e945960/tumblr_inline_nxckm8zEjG1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"359\"/></figure></a><p>Standing in one spot outdoors for too long is probably not a smart idea. Actually, being outside for too long is not a good idea in general. If you can’t hide indoors, keep your body moving and the blood flowing to make sure your own temp doesn’t drop. This means your ritual sunbathing or reading on a bench in WSP is a no-go. Besides, there are still <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foursquare.com/hashtagnyu/lists/created\">a ton of (warmer) places</a> to hangout or study around campus.</p>\n<br/><h2>7. Enjoy winter activities</h2><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1fhtcgr\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"360\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/34944938c1ca0971ea7100c2ad8630c3/tumblr_inline_nxckmhpbhj1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"360\"/></figure></a><p>Winter will come no matter what, so you might as well embrace it!

The show starts at a point when she had\nended her superhero career and entered the private investigations field, using\nher detective skills mostly to spy on cheating spouses. Until one case, where\nshe’s looking for a missing college student, leads her back to a man with\nmind-controlling abilities, who is obsessed with her. What appealed to me about\nthis show was that it addresses issues relating to gender, race, discrimination\namong many others, without deviating from its narrative taking place in a world\nwhere superhuman abilities exist, and that its characters can’t be\ncompartmentalized into good or bad and are more complex individuals. I cropped\nscenes from the first few episodes of the show, rearranged them in an order\nthat would help get my message across and used text slides to transition\nbetween segments to point the viewer’s mind to think in a certain direction.</p><p>     This show\nsucceeds in getting a true feminist perspective because it is created by a\nwoman – Melissa Rosenberg – about a woman and covers many aspects of being a\nwoman like coping with living in a patriarchal society, facing sexism and other\nkinds of problems. In a ‘politically aware’ society, a show has to have a\ndiverse cast to avoid criticism and the show manages to include a variety demographics\nincluding Blacks, and lesbians, among others. But it’s notable how this show\nuses this diversity. In her essay ‘Eating The Other’, Bel Hooks writes that\n“like the “primitivism” Hal Foster maintains “absorbs the primitive in part via\nthe concept of affinity” contemporary notions of “crossover” expand the\nparameters of cultural production to enable the voice of the non-white Other to\nbe heard by a larger audience even as it denies the specificity of that voice,\nor as it recoups it for its own use (21).” In other words, she’s trying to say\nthat although “the Other” or the minority is included in the cultural\nproductions, and are given a platform to reach a wider audience, the\nspecificity of their conditions or their own feelings fail to be portrayed in a\nnarrative where they aren’t the lead characters. The show <i>Jessica Jones</i> accepts this limitation and although it includes\nthese different groups, it doesn’t deviate from the perspective of the white\nfemale protagonist. So instead of getting deep into problems the Black community\nfaces, it’ll show us this issue in context of how it relates to the\nprotagonist. For example when she uses the tendency of people to profile a\nBlack male as an attacker to break divert people’s attention and break into a\nhospital to steal drugs. </p><p>     Furthermore, Marvel\nuses super-humans and the problems they face when dealing with other people to\nsymbolize discrimination of any kind like it did with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/04/25/bryan_singer_x_men_2_interview.shtml\">the\nX-men series</a>. Since these people don’t belong to any race or social class\nthat usually face discrimination, their abilities provide yet another element\nthat could lead to discrimination. This is obvious when Jessica is grouped with\nother “gifted” people for “the incident” in New York that she had nothing to do\nwith, and is facing a hate crime because of that. The “incident” they are\ntalking about is one that occurred in <i>The\nAvengers </i>movie when aliens attacked the earth.</p><p>     This show concurs\nwith the same arc that Linda Williams associates with the body genres – female victimization.\nThis show loosely falls under the genre of drama and thriller, and Williams’\nobservations can be used to study it. In talking about the psychoanalytic\nsystem of analysis that’s influential in film study, she claims that these\ngenres are marked by an excess. “The categories of fetishism, voyeurism, sadism\nand masochism” are frequently invoked to describe the pleasures of film\nspectatorship according to Williams. “Perversions are usually defined as\nexcesses, specifically as excesses which are deflected away from “proper” end goals\nonto substitute goals or objects – fetishes instead of genitals, looking\ninstead of touching,etc.” (6). This fits well in this case where the antagonist\nis obsessed with the female protagonist and the moment this usually strong\nwoman appears to be the most fearful is when she realizes that he’s been\nwatching her and has a collection of her photos. He even blackmails her to send\nhim a picture of her everyday – to feed his voyeurism. The antagonist adopts\nwhat Mulvey calls the extreme of scopophilia, “fixated into a perversion,\nproducing obsessive voyeurs or Peeping Toms, whose only sexual satisfaction can\ncome from watching, in an active controlling sense, an objectified other” (835).</p><p>     Williams talks\nexplains an argument advanced by Carol Clover, which suggests that “pleasure,\nfor a masculine-identified viewer, oscillates between identifying with the\ninitial passive powerlessness of the abject and terrorized girl-victim of\nhorror and her later, active empowerment” (6-7). This show to some degree has\nfallen into this category where even a woman with super strength meets a man\nstronger than her – due to his mind-controlling powers – and she’s become a girl-victim\nof this man trying to dominate her. It started off digressing from the image of\na powerless woman, so the question is whether it’s going to progress into the classic\nempowerment of this now-helpless woman or do the writers have a surprise in\nstore for us?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133899281209,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZDPmJv1yj1ECv","DateString":"2015-11-25","Text":"<p>Considering transferring out of my college in the mountains and looking into NYU or Columbia, anybody have any advice about living in the city??</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133893847851,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z-Z5-x1yiiVih","DateString":"2015-11-25","Text":"<p>I&rsquo;m graduating what #nyu #seniors?</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133892451211,"NoteCount":5,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZmxRXw1yidAkB","DateString":"2015-11-24","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133891550144,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZX1qrl1yiZkl0","DateString":"2015-11-24","Text":"Freshman Year: I'm only going to eat at the dining hall when my friends are available.\nJunior Year: Who cares.

Studies have shown that, when given identical resumes except for the names (where one sounded white and the other sounded nonwhite), employers tended to react more positively to those with white names. THAT is systematic institutional racism. It&rsquo;s not an individual economic issue&ndash;&ldquo;I struggled, too!&rdquo; does not mean that people of color are by and large exempt from struggling&ndash;it&rsquo;s a sociopolitical issue on a group scale. People of color create student unions in order to advocate for equality in a predominantly white-biased society. White students are not &ldquo;supposed to be ashamed of being white,&rdquo; nor are they told that their voice doesn&rsquo;t matter. It&rsquo;s that a student union exists in order to give less privileged and largely marginalized groups a place to have their concerns voiced.

We have lots to share with you, so stay tuned.<br/></p><p>On Tuesday October 20th, NYU played host to the PRSA Tri-State Conference. While most of the day’s events were geared toward PR professionals, there was a student session, where three PR pro’s, including an SVP at Edelman and the Founder of Day One Agency, shared tips for making a successful career in PR after graduation. Here’s a roundup of some of their best advice:</p><p>1) <b>Don’t underestimate the importance of informational interviewing.</b> All the panelists stressed that PR is built on connections and relationships, so the best way to lay the groundwork for a successful career is to grow your network while you’re still in school. Speaker Rob Longert said that 90% of the people his firm, Day One Agency, has hired have come from referrals, while Lisa Kovitz, an SVP at Edelman, claimed that connections have helped her land every position she’s ever had.</p><p>2) <b>Entering the workforce without experience doesn’t have to hurt you.</b> The panelists said that they will hire people with no prior PR experience if they can show in their application how their other experiences, such as summer jobs, volunteering, or coursework, gave them skills that will enable them to succeed in PR. Lisa suggested that another way to get noticed is to create a blog or social media account that represents who you are and what you are passionate about and good at, as she claimed that she has hired people after being impressed by their online presence.</p><p>3) <b>Make sure to take an active role as an intern.</b> The panelists noted that interns are often so grateful to be at a company that they are willing to do anything there. While doing scut work with a good attitude is important, interns should also tell their supervisors what they want to learn and gain from the experience. Companies like interns who can contribute fresh ideas and perspectives, so by making your voice heard you are helping them and yourself.</p><p> On Wednesday October 21st, Chris Brown, an Account Director at top PR firm Grayling, came to our meeting. He spoke and answered questions about internship and post-graduation opportunities at the global agency.

MOGUL is currently seeking contributors \n\nwho will share their knowledge and opinions with others by writing articles, sharing job listings, recommending products, and more.

Bill talked about his path and experiences, shared insights he’s gained throughout his many decades in the industry, and posed for a great group photo!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"464\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/f65b040c33d50e5a5e38be6dadc5d107/tumblr_inline_ny3nozeS3i1qkawr7_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"464\"/></figure><p>Bill also passed on some great PR tips, which you can check out here:</p><p>1) <b>Writing well is one of the best skills you can have. </b>PR professionals are constantly required to produce written materials that will be distributed to wide audiences, such as clients and the media, so writing well will make a good impression and lead to stronger connections. Bill also noted that being a good writer is the key to success in any field.</p><p>2) <b>Finding a mentor is imperative to achieving success.</b> He mentioned that he has had many mentors throughout his long career, and that all of them have helped him greatly. He stressed that your mentors don’t have to be people you work for, and suggested looking online (such as on LinkedIn) to find and reach out to people whose career path interests you.</p><p>3) <b>Promote yourself whenever possible.</b> While Bill had a lot of great one-liners, the one that stood out the most was “self-promotion is your second job.” Although no one likes to feel that they’re bragging or coming off as arrogant when they talk to others, especially strangers, it is necessary to quickly and effectively convey your strengths to new people you meet, as you never know who might be impressed and open more doors.</p><p>Don’t forget to regularly check our Facebook and Twitter pages, as they are where we post about upcoming meetings and internship opportunities!<br/></p><p>Have a great week!</p><p>Heather Schindler</p><p><i>Vice President of Social Media</i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612969323,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZKqciu1yRz1rh","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>Education panel at NYU</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612917560,"NoteCount":134,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1yRyrCu","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>This view never gets old! 😍</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133612856318,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZSj_gj1yRycF_","DateString":"2015-11-20","Text":"<p>Oh man Oman!

It’s about feeling isolated as a Cambodian American in the United States and navigating one’s identity, history, and trauma. I draw from my own experiences, having grown up not in Lowell or Long Beach where Cambodian communities are thriving—but in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I hope Cambodian Americans read this book to continue the ongoing conversation about our shared history and how it has shaped our experience(s). I also hope my book complicates these discussions, offering a different insight into what it means to be Cambodian American. Year Zero is for anyone interested in processing the history of the killing fields and how it has shaped our lives as children of survivors. </p><!-- more --><p>I wrote this book because growing up, I wasn’t learning about Cambodia in history class or reading about it in textbooks. Toni Morrison says, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s a book that you want to read, but it hasn&rsquo;t been written yet, then you must write it.&rdquo; Year Zero is my response to that. I also want to pass down Toni Morrison’s words to Cambodian American youths. I’m encouraging you all to write the book that hasn&rsquo;t been written yet. </p><p>KHMERICAN: How can your book heal Cambodians? </p><p>MONICA SOK: I’m not sure if my book has the power to heal anybody, but writing it has been healing for me. Throughout my life, I have felt isolated as a Cambodian American, and I know that there are others who share the same experiences—whether they have felt out of place in a predominantly white high school or grew up in a small town where there were only two or three other Cambodian families, etc. Writing has helped me make my experience visible to those who treat it as invisible. Year Zero is my way of simply saying to other Cambodian Americans: I see you. Your story is important. You are important. </p><p>Part of this book also struggles to process the history of the killing fields as a personal and public history. A Cambodian might read my poems and say, But why do we need another story about the Khmer Rouge? That’s been done before. I’m aware of this. Every Cambodian story is about that. So often the mainstream Cambodian narrative falls to victimhood or recollects the trauma of the killing fields. But like every Cambodian, I can’t escape the history I have inherited.

I have, however, been reading! I’m currently 100 pages (this is A LOT for me) into Between The World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates. It’s definitely been a super hard reading for me with all the literary magic and historical references, but also just the challenge I need right now. With my Facebook being dominated by “experts” in international politics, institutionalized racism, and white people who refuse to acknowledge that racism is still a thing, this book is a way for me to focus all of my energy on a single narrative. To listen, read, and feel without the ability to form my own opinion or speak against it. I mean, it’s a published book, right?</p><p>Lately, I’ve also been consumed in my schoolwork. I don’t know about any other STEM students, but isn’t it weird how emotional and physical stress comes second to academic stress? Maybe I should use some I-statements here: I, Angie, am literally INCAPABLE of managing more than one stress at a time. Two weeks ago, my stress was coming to terms with the homophobia within my family. A week ago, it was coming out to my father, who was notorious for being a racist and homophobe - luckily, things went well. With the support of my girlfriend, my two best friends, and some double chocolate chip pancakes at iHop to celebrate, that night of coming out was a lot easier than I have ever imagined. </p><p>-Pause: in case if anyone is late, I’m hellllla queer in all the ways (gender &amp; sexuality). At this time, I came out to my dad as “gay,” because I’m not even going to try to get into conversation about other genders outside the gender binary.-</p><p>I told the rest of my family and my therapist about coming out to my biological father - and they were all proud and supportive. But part of me still feels empty. Sure, I’m out to the “world,” essentially. But I can’t help but feel that I’m being forced back into the closet.</p><p>What makes me feel this way, you may ask. It’s the way my family won’t say “gay,” louder than a hushed tone. The way I’ve been told to keep my relationships on the DL. It’s the way that my girlfriend (or any of my past female partners) have been referred to as my, “friend,” rather than as my partners, girlfriends, hook ups, etc. I’m tired of my identity being erased - this spans across my family and to other contexts. And there are times where I do “censor” it myself, by using language such as “bae,” or “partner.” Part of me feels a little crappy about it, but I know it’s for survival - to put it in a real way. Sometimes I don’t feel safe or comfortable coming out to people, especially being at an engineering school. NYU Tandon has not proved itself to be LGBTQ friendly (or even women-friendly, tbh) just yet, considering “gay” is still thrown around as an insult and men are still doing stuff “like a girl.” </p><p>I’ve got to go study for MATLAB, but I’ve had the sudden urge to write a blog post tonight!</p><p><br/></p><p>This is all I’ve got for now! Feel free to leave me any questions in my ask! :)</p><p>Keep swimming,</p><p>Angie</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133377105820,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZbkGRo1yDvH_S","DateString":"2015-11-17","Text":"<p>The biggest bean bag has made it all fuzzy #lovesac #NYU #setlife  (at Shen Tao Studio)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133374163840,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZhinJy1yDk3k0","DateString":"2015-11-17","Text":"<p>Matching with my pbaes &amp;&amp; pseudo biggie for the last day of pledge class 💙💛 #NYU #ΑΦΩ #ΑΩ</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133366045431,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zavj4m1yDF5ht","DateString":"2015-11-16","Text":"<p>NYU Blackout</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":133360299815,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zsy-yq1yCvAyd","DateString":"2015-11-16","Text":"<p>\n\n<b>WHAT: </b><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1025665667484397/\" target=\"_blank\">NYU Vigil for Baghdad, Beirut, and Paris</a><br/><b>DATE: </b>Tuesday, November 17<br/><b>TIME: </b>4:30PM<br/><b>LOCATION: </b>Kimmel (Grand Staircase) <br/></p><!-- more --><p>\n\nOn Thursday, November 12th, two suicide bombers killed 43 people and wounded 239 more in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. <br/><br/>On Friday, November 13th, there were coordinated attacks at six locations throughout Paris that killed at least 129 people and wounded at least 352 more. <br/><br/>On Friday, November 13th, there was a suicide blast and a roadside bombing that targeted Shiites in Baghdad that killed 26 people and wounded dozens more. <br/><br/>These horrific events shook the world.

Unfortunately, the Kickstarter was over, but something moved me to email Leanne in hopes that there was some way to still get in on the action. Especially since she raised well over $140,000, and with all of my non-profit jobs, the fine print on the page mentioned that she would be donating copies to not-for-profit organizations! *win* So long story short, I sent an email detailing my many classes and how the demographics that she is focusing on are exactly my students and their families. So The Universe worked in our favor, and a few months later, after paying just for shipping, a small, but heavy box arrives to my door crammed full of 20 of these amazing books! A few months following that box, I received an email stating that I was selected for ANOTHER FREE BOX of books!!!!!!!!!! The families were oh so grateful to receive the books!!! Thank you Leanne Brown and your thesis statement that turned into such a useful tool for anyone and everyone to have in their kitchen! </p><p>Fast forward to October 2015, I come across an advert for her book tour which came to Upshur Bookstore in Washington, DC! I could not miss such an opportunity to finally meet Leanne to remind her [as I am sure everyone says it, including the Washington Post] how great of a resource this is for nonprofit organizations and their clients, who can purchase this book at a discounted rate. Best part of the night, was chatting with her to find out that next she is considering a children’s book, and that she remembered my name [how many Shaymar’s could there be, right]! Such a beautiful and passionate woman, and I am grateful to have found out about the book and to have met her!

Why am I so bad at ironing?  </b><a href=\"http://jonesrooy-shanghai.tumblr.com/post/132158364118/10-things-ive-learned-from-filming-myself\" target=\"_blank\">I now iron every morning</a> and still look like a mess on camera.  Maybe the camera adds &hellip; wrinkles.  Best not to think about it.</p><p><b>2. Should I wear my hair down?</b>  No, because then it gets in my face.  But if I pull it back I look like a horse.  What about half up?  No, that’s too “Tom Cruise in Magnolia.”  Shit, have I accidentally been filming this whole time?  Sorry, people who have to edit this.</p><p><b>3. What is the point of teaching? </b> In five years of teaching and many more of TA-ing I’ve never thought about this.  Now I think about it all the time.  Having to constrain myself to just four 7-minute videos means I have to be really deliberate about what I am saying to students.  This means choosing between different things, like &ndash; should I be summarizing the readings (they’re hard)?  Should I be connecting them to each other?  Should I be connecting them to the real world?  Should I be talking about something else and let the readings speak for themselves?  In a normal classroom the answer to all of these questions is a moving target version of “yes”, but now I don’t have the luxury of 2.5 hours in front of a room to do it all.  So it makes me really, really think hard: What am I trying to say?</p><p>Put another way &ndash; What is the value-added of a teacher?  My students are smart, can’t they just do the readings and the assignments without my videos, and then if they have questions I could be there to answer them?  If that’s true, why do we even have universities in the first place?</p><p>My college boyfriend used to say that the point of college was to make you read things that you want to read anyway but would never otherwise get around to.  I don’t think he’s wrong, but so far my best improved answer to this question is &ndash; my job is to make you want to read about all this in the first place.</p><p>Maybe?  I’m curious to hear what others think about this.</p><p><b>4. Should I coordinate my outfit with my slides?</b>  Yes.  I have become Ms. Frizzle.  It turns out, if the color of your clothes is too similar to the slides, it looks like you got sucked into them.  I wore a black dress against black slides one day and it looked like being taught by a floating head (not an altogether bad look once you get used to it).  Other times if your colors are too far off, the light hits either you or the slides weirdly.  I had to put a sweater on once to mute a light shirt that was reflecting weirdly off a dark screen.  Today I think I nailed it, though &ndash; grey slides with navy blue headings, and a navy blue shirt!  Here’s the secret: you just want matching accents.</p><p><b>5. How do I fold the Jurassic Park theme song into every aspect of my life?  </b>By opening the videos with music!  So far we are going to enjoy a bit of Bach one day, the sound of applause on Standing Ovation day, and, yes indeed, the theme song to the best movie ever on “beauty” day.  The irony of Professor T-Rex teaching to dinosaur music is not lost on me, and is in fact deliberate.</p><p><b>6. Am I bipolar?  </b>I shot two modules (module = one week of material) this week.  In the first one, I had to do a million takes and would lie on the floor in between them for half an hour at a time.  Today I did each of the four parts in almost one take and was jumping out of the screen constantly with excitement.  Students, when you watch Modules 4 and 5 please diagnose me.</p><p><b>7. Should I do another take?</b>  Maybe not?  An open question we are dealing with is whether to aim for a perfect/polished set of videos, or videos that are more the “real life” (meaning mistake-filled) Andrea Jones-Rooy experience.  This is a real dilemma.  Since these are being preserved for all eternity (obviously), the temptation every time I stumble over a word is to stop the tape and redo it.  But I’ve been watching a lot of Khan academy videos and <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/model-thinking/lecture/IdA4x/the-standing-ovation-model\" target=\"_blank\">videos of my advisor</a>, the great Scott E. Page, on Coursera, and there’s something about them seeming “real” that is appealing.  I don’t know yet which is better.  N.b. I almost knocked over the screen one day while filming and then was like “KEEP THAT IT’S PERFECT FOR ENTROPY.”</p><p><b>8. Is this a good idea at all?</b>  Some days I think this is going to be the best thing ever.  Other days I think, how can anyone ever learn from this shit?  How am I going to monitor online participation?  What’s going to keep people interested in a bunch videos?  How am I going to handle not talking in person with my students about these really hard concepts?</p><p><b>9. Why am I doing this?  </b>This process is fucking hard.  I almost never sleep, I have no social life, and I’m in the thick of it all so it’s not like I can just stop.  Sure, it’s only four 7-minute videos, but that means preparing all new material (not only is it a brand new course for me, but I’ve also never even taught in this field before) like I would for an in-person class, THEN figuring out how to distill it into 4 short movies, THEN filming it, which so far has never taken less than 2 hours (today was the fastest), THEN coming home and preparing for my real class, then after that preparing for this all over again.  And I still don’t know how we are going to actually run the damn course.</p><p><b>10. How could I have forgotten how much I love complexity?</b>  Rediscovering complexity has been the real joy of all of this.  Filming and everything is also really fun, but my goodness did I forget how this subject makes my heart beat faster.  Either that or it’s all the coffee.</p><p>And now, I’m off to perform standup for a room with PEOPLE in it &ndash; won’t that be weird!  See you next time, students, friends, dinosaurs!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/ae48cdde1c7e6b8ab9ec5f8d69741046/tumblr_inline_nxe5abdDIe1qzy3cw_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\"/></figure><p><b>Fig. 1.  Professor T-Rex enjoys some coffee, modesty.</b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"950\" data-orig-height=\"596\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://36.media.tumblr.com/4a6f860044995a5a5c6b5db4c8d8ec2b/tumblr_inline_nxe5arppbn1qzy3cw_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"950\" data-orig-height=\"596\"/></figure><p><b>Fig. 2.  I’m definitely bipolar.</b></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132651655295,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZBz40y1xYfw1-","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>#timeflies #aliceinwonderland #nyc #nyu</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132641649026,"NoteCount":12,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZGSkMy1xY3l62","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132637526619,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZNuH7j1xXq0fR","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>Free time at NYU #washingtonsquarepark #nyu #autumndays #nyc (at Washington Square Park)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132634315661,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZRs-7y1xXdmkD","DateString":"2015-11-06","Text":"<p>Screening of my friend @be__squared &rsquo;s senior thesis film, &ldquo;Blood and Water&rdquo;.

One of our own Undergraduate Fellows, Wenbo Wang, led his team on the opposing side, highlighting how organized religion can create conflict.  A detailed overview of the debate and the arguments made on both sides can be found <a href=\"http://www.nyunews.com/2015/10/28/sexton-students-debate-religions-place-in-society/#prettyPhoto\">here</a>.</p><p>It’s no accident that Wenbo, a CAS Junior, was chosen to enter the fray with our illustrious president. He has been involved with political and debate organizations on campus throughout his time at NYU. As part of The Review and Debates, he participated in a debate with Professor Alastair Smith, and it was his excellent performance that made him a candidate for the Sexton Debate.</p><figure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2000\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"><img src=\"https://41.media.tumblr.com/67e7f9d637042bf5838838fcb61b6078/tumblr_inline_nxaqgunh5w1t25dex_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"2000\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"/></figure><p>Wenbo generously shared with us his experiences and reflections on campus leadership. We asked him for his input on how to overcome reservations or fears before participating in large, public events. After all, it requires initiative and courage to take on a heated issue and high-profile opponent! He believes that the best antidote for nerves is careful preparation and practice, saying, “I overcame any concerns by practicing my speeches and getting feedback from my friends and teammates.” He cautions that this does not make him fearless, encouraging students who may be too nervous to take that first step that, “It’s not about never being nervous, but rather acknowledging that uncertainty and going forward anyway.”</p><p>Wenbo also shared how his definition and practice of leadership have been shaped by many people, explaining that “professors, coaches, and friends have all been a big part of my life; I would not be where I am without their advice and mentorship. Their experience and feedback have shaped me to be more critical in my argumentation and a much better orator.”</p><p>These experiences contributed to Wenbo&rsquo;s desire to “ have an intellectual dialogue with both President Sexton and the audience to challenge the notions that have been taken for granted for far too long.” For Wenbo, the value of the debate was less about personal ideology and instead about “confronting ideas largely not challenged, [and getting] people to expand their understanding on the subject.” This sentiment was echoed by President Sexton who pointed out that the final vote (50-24, in his favor) was inconsequential compared to the value of the dialogue and discussion.<br/></p><p>In the spirit of truly inclusive leadership, the real winners of the debate were all the students, faculty, and community members who engaged with a diverse array of perspectives on an issue that plays a such critical role in people&rsquo;s lives. </p><p>Thank you, Wenbo, for sharing your reflections with us, and we can’t wait to see what you are up to next!<br/></p><p>For anyone interested in nominating an individual, pair or group of students to be featured in our #NYULeaders series, simply email <a href=\"mailto:leadershipinitiative@nyu.edu\">leadershipinitiative@nyu.edu</a> with a name and email as well as two to three sentences about how your nominee(s) is practicing ethical, collaborative, and inclusive leadership! </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132539126127,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZO8XBl1xRyf5l","DateString":"2015-11-04","Text":"<figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/8771bf5ea0860208697307b6bf43c37a/tumblr_inline_nxaq23vDGy1tpnpgl_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/></figure><p>Please check the link below from the Graduate Center events calendar.

I will use data from music-related sources such as WhoSampled, Billboard and iTunes to create maps and graphs about the sampled artists.</p><p>This idea is inspired by a couple of things. First, on my blog, I started a series called <a href=\"http://loves-holiday.com/post/39891026744/why-sample-sundays\">Sample Sundays</a>, where I highlighted songs that were used as samples in some great hip hop songs. I haven’t done it in a while but I still think it’s a worthwhile venture. Second, I’m inspired by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthew_daniels/\">Matt Daniels</a>, who basically makes all of the things I wish I could make. He runs a site called <a href=\"http://poly-graph.co\">Polygraph</a>, where he and other awesome people make things like <a href=\"http://poly-graph.co/labels/\">The Most Successful Labels in Hip Hop</a> and <a href=\"http://poly-graph.co/timeless/\">The Most Timeless Songs of All-Time</a>.</p><p>The intended audience for this is anyone interested in music, but especially people who make beats or care about how a song comes together.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Here’s the structure I imagine for the project:</b></p><p>A lead image with a title and an introductory blurb explaining what sampling is and why it matters.

These graphics are: a map of where each artist originated; genres of the artists; stats on Grammy awards and nominations; Billboard Hot 100 singles; and a few very popular/recognizable songs that sampled songs from the group of artists.

How has law been used to sustain social inequality, and to\nchallenge inequality. What new legal problems arise when attempts are made to\nuse law as an instrument of social chanag? In our discussion of law and\ninequality we will be giving particular attention to inequalities associated with social class,\nrace, sex and sexual orientation.\n\n\n\n<br/></p><p>\n\n<b>2) What is one book or article you will discuss in class?  </b><br/></p><p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne\nbook we will be discussing is John Sutton’s Law/Society: Origins,\nInteractions and Change.<br/></p><p><b>\n\n3) How is this course structured?\n\n<br/></b></p><p>This interdisciplinary course\ncontains both lectures and discussion. It draws on theory and research in\nsociology, anthropology, history, political science, philosophy, economics and\njurisprudence. There will be no exams. \nDuring the semester, students will write four short papers.</p><p><b>\n\n4) How can a non-Sociology major benefit from this course?\n\n</b><br/></p><p>Non-majors will gain a better\nunderstanding of an extremely important part of contemporary societies (as will\nmajors). Although the course is in no way a preview of a law school course, it\nwill offer students considering going to law school an exposure to alternative\nperspectives on law developed in the social sciences. </p><p>Learn more about Professor David Greenberg <a href=\"http://sociology.as.nyu.edu/object/davidgreenberg.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"3888\" data-orig-height=\"2916\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/981f788f8cb19ee88d16b973949488b2/tumblr_inline_nx1exck5JU1tq86mg_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3888\" data-orig-height=\"2916\"/></figure>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132218460483,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZrCISo1x8rPb3","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132215661679,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZDIpJt1x8gkHl","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":"<figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\" data-tumblr-attribution=\"humor-trash:eEnZk9YMmm3Kmb-JYifSew:Zyh2kp1vJzHEb\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/befb07f908146a78847d2533b2066a4d/tumblr_nvj74oh9X21t2e874o1_250.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>Happy Halloween NYU!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132214496503,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZiU6_p1x8cHpt","DateString":"2015-10-30","Text":"<p>Final version of #WynnieAsASuperhero, by Aton: @i_aton!

But Liv asked me to come with, and when she bats her eyelashes and gets that look on her face, I am compelled as if by some magical force, and have to do whatever my fiancée wants Even if it’s completely crazy.<br/>\tLiv, frankly, doesn’t do things like his much either, but she had been trying for a long time to make friends at the hospital, so when Marcie, her ex-nemesis coworker asked her, she felt like she had to go. <br/>\tAt first, I was going let her go by herself, because if Marcie hated Liv, she hated me even more, just for existing and having large biceps. But like I said, neither of us really does that kind of thing. So she figured it would be good if she had me in her corner. And frankly, I’d had the kind of shit day at the children’s shelter that can only be mitigated by alcohol, shoot-em-up video games, or both. <br/>\tWe had no clue what we were getting into.<br/>\tAt first, everything was fine.  I mean, sure, the number of people who were high off their asses was out of my comfort zone, but we had a couple drinks, met some of Marcie’s friends, and, as it turned out, maybe Drunk Marcie didn’t hate us quite as much as Sober Marcie. And maybe she was kind of fun to hang out with? Kind of?<br/>\tAnyway, it turned out that the whole boat party was put together by this gross energy drink company called Max Rager, and they were handing out free samples to everyone they could get their scantily-clad salesgirls close to. We avoided them. And the drug dealers. We danced, we had a good time. Marcie, on the other hand, got high as shit on some new, dangerous stuff called utopium and mixed it with the godawful energy drink. She was gone.<br/>\tAt first, she was telling me and Liv all about how adorable we were, and how wrong it was that we were so goddamn perfect or something. (Which is ridiculous, first off nobody’s perfect, and second, we’re both self-sacrificing exercise-nut workaholics with no time for each other, let alone “perfect lives”. Or, well, I guess we were.) <br/>\tBut then, she got this crazy look in her eyes, and went basically nonverbal except for the occasional murmur about how high she was and how good this shit was. We were about to take her home and get the fuck off that boat when the party turned into an actual scene from a zombie movie. <br/>\tThat is not an exaggeration. <br/>\tWhile we were trying to pull her away from the boat, Marcie bit me on the arm. Hard. And while I was still trying to process what had just happened, she went for Liv. I tried to stop her, but before I knew it, there were, like, twenty different people trying to kill us and just about everyone else on the boat. We pushed and shoved and tried to get to the side, screaming and trying to hold onto each other for dear life. <br/>\tI’m not really sure what happened after that. I woke up in a body bag on the beach, feeling like a bug holding onto its last bits of life after a shoe fell on top of it. That is not a situation I relish being in ever again. Oh, and did I mention the sudden onset of a serious craving for fresh, hot, human brains straight from the skull? Because that’s a thing that happened.<br/>\tI ripped open the body bag, and quickly discovered that being a zombie also means having the senses of a mentally impaired rhinoceros. Color vision was kinda there, but my nose seemed to have just plain stopped working, and my whole body seemed to be mildly numb. But none of that mattered. Because nothing was more important than brains brains brains brains brains. <br/>\tBut that was before I saw Liv. She had spontaneously developed a white streak in her long brown hair, was angry-Goth-kid pale, and was running away from the beach as fast as she possibly could. <br/>\tAnd running away from me too. I rushed after her, stumbling over a beach full of body bags and horrified paramedics. She had just reached the forest when I got up, but in my hunger-haze I was just lucid enough to yell out, “Liv! Hey! Liv, it’s Major! Wait up!” She paused. “Major! Oh my God! Major, you made it! You’re here! I thought you were dead…” Then I caught up to her…and she visibly recoiled.<br/>\t“You…did what happened to me…did it also happen to you? Are you weirdly hungry too? Major, what the fuck is going on here?” “I don’t know, Liv. I have no clue. But at least we can figure it out together.”<br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":132096995714,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn1x1c362","DateString":"2015-10-28","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/230343222&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>On a special edition of Weekend Events, <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/rachel-ag-gilman\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel A.G.

It’s truly one of the top research libraries in the world and has tons of perks that many students neglect. So&hellip;start using them! Here’s everything you need to know to get the most out of your library.</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"265\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/70eee9ffff4a5106ae9f39d8d0db8074/tumblr_inline_nv51p6cEgg1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"265\"/></figure><!-- more -->\n<br/><h2>Study Spots</h2>\n<p>The most important part of any Bobst session is understanding what you’re trying to accomplish. If you’re looking for a quiet study spot, try one of the north rooms on any of the even-numbered floors or any wing on any floor, really. It is a library after all&hellip;</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"441\" data-orig-height=\"384\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/2788a41984ed6649ba3ed8a11be0ac6c/tumblr_inline_nv502983581ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"435\"/></figure><p>But sometimes you need to do more than independent study, and there’s space for that too! If you’re looking to talk or meet with a group, go to Fifth Floor South, or book a <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/services/group_study.html\">study room.</a></p>\n\n<p> Some other areas you might want to hit:</p>\n<ul><li><b>Periodicals (Third Floor East): </b>This room has a ton of interesting periodicals from all over the world. From Sports Illustrated to The Economist, come here to relax for a bit and read.  <br/></li>\n\n<li><b>Avery Fischer Center (Second Floor):</b> On the second floor, there are a bunch of DVDs and movies that you can watch. You can also import thousands of CD’s to your iTunes/music library! It’s unfortunately same-day return, but there are lots of eclectic old movies and desks where you can study in silence.<br/></li><li><b>New School Library, Cooper Union Library, Columbia Library, etc:</b> In addition to granting you access to Bobst, NYU has a consortium <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/about/columbia.html\">with</a> <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/about/locations.html#consortium\">tons</a> of libraries <a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/partners.html\">across the country</a> where you can get a guest pass. (Bonus:  if your friends are visiting from one of these other schools, they can get a free guest pass at Bobst, too). Check out <a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/partners.html\">all the amazing places across the world</a> where your card can get you access<a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/shares/partners.html\">!</a></li></ul><br/><h2>Research Databases</h2>\n<p>Picturesque study spots are just the beginning of the Bobst benefits. Your NYU Card also grants you access to thousands of amazing research databases that are excellent for any essay. Plus, <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/tipoftheweek?3\">NYU’s access</a> to the <a href=\"https://arch.library.nyu.edu/?&amp;base=databases&amp;action=find&amp;query=new%20yorker\">New Yorker</a> and <a href=\"http://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=276635&amp;p=1845243\">NYTimes</a> means that you can read pretty much any issue for free! Sweet deal, huh?</p><br/><h2>Checking Out Books</h2><p>YES! You can check books out of Bobst. Mind blown, right?</p><br/><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"243\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/3541e1d767ea85b2a5164b0c69b4c273/tumblr_inline_nv4zzbzaoK1ro0zrp_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"243\"/></figure><p>Don’t be embarrassed — if you forgot how to look for and check out books, it’ll be our little secret. Here’s a quick guide of how to do it:</p><ol><li>Look up the <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/\">call number online</a>. Pro Tip: <b>Make sure it says “on shelf;” </b>when it says “available” it isn’t always <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/bobcat/availability.html\"><i>really</i> available .</a><br/></li><li>The books are sorted alphabetically by call number. There’s a directory at each elevator bank you can reference.<br/></li><li>If the book isn’t there, make sure to check the shelving room (on any floor above three), which is always in the southeast corner.<br/></li><li>If it isn’t there either, talk to a staff member who may have just received it. (Or the book could be stolen&hellip; Either way, talk to a staff member.)<br/></li></ol><br/><h2>Course Reserves</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"571\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/642531840b11d532e95f2d6c7dd0f26e/tumblr_inline_nw4dvlovBx1ro0zrp_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"571\"/></figure><p>Many professors are generous and place books or articles for class at Course Reserves. These books come with certain privileges and can’t be found in the main stacks. Here’s how to use them:</p><ol><li>Make sure to have the call number in advance. You can find this on the library home<a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/\"> page</a> by searching under the ‘Course Reserves’ tab. </li><li>Go to the main desk on the first floor (the desk used to be on LL2, but they moved!)</li><li>The book is yours for two hours, or if you check them out within two hours of reserves closing, they are due the next morning when they open.</li></ol><p>Fun fact: This is also where you get markers for whiteboards in study rooms! They’re due back by the end of the day.</p>\n<br/><h2><b>Leaving Bobst</b></h2>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"211\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/75e8c676ebcfade55e23f14f7bde3750/tumblr_inline_nv4zwzdmtC1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"635\"/></figure><p>Yes, exiting Bobst can be surprisingly more complicated than opening a door&hellip; When you leave, make sure that your books (even ones you checked out!) are handed to the person at the exit desk. Don’t ask why this is the system, nobody knows. Well, some people do. It’s kinda a secret or something&hellip;</p><p>Remember: If all else fails, ask a librarian! <a href=\"http://library.nyu.edu/ask/\">You can email, IM, even text them for help if you need it</a>. There’s an incredible staff dedicated to making sure that you get the most out of your research library, so don’t be afraid to approach them.

Last Thursday, I was in the darkroom for more than 4 hours. Most of the day before was spent gaining a deeper understanding of C and Assembly. A significant amount of time this weekend was devoted to writing a specialized data structure in Java. While I like the fact that my schedule is flexible enough for me to do this, I&rsquo;ve found that breaking things into smaller chunks really helps. It let&rsquo;s your mind recover from intensive thinking on one subject while still being productive. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m taking a break from studying Algorithms to write another update post. Today&rsquo;s topic is music. Specifically percussion. Specifically my experience with percussion at NYU.\n<!-- more -->\nMy perception of the percussion scene here is influenced mainly by the ensembles that I am a part of, NYU Community Orchestra and NYU Rhythmic Impulse (NYURI). I also know that NYU Steinhardt has quite the percussion performance program, with a great percussion ensemble and headquarters called the <em>Percussion Penthouse</em>. Unfortunately, the ensemble and Penthouse are exclusive to students in the percussion program. I was extremely disappointed to hear this, but in the grand scheme of things, it is (very, very) understandable.\nHere&rsquo;s an unorganized list of what I&rsquo;ve learned through these two groups:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>The relatively low intensity of Community Orchestra is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it&rsquo;s great only having one rehearsal a week. But on the other, it&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to come late because there&rsquo;s no penalty for doing so.</p></li>\n<li><p>I&rsquo;ve gotten <strong>very</strong> rusty. But that&rsquo;s not all. I think I&rsquo;ve also lost some confidence. Back when I was in high school and regularly practicing, hard passages wouldn&rsquo;t really phase me. I&rsquo;d face them head on and do my best. If it didn&rsquo;t work out, so what? I&rsquo;d simply try again. Now, I get caught up. I&rsquo;m actively working on getting to where I used to be. It&rsquo;ll be hard, but I feel that I can do it.</p></li>\n<li><p>NYURI is NYU&rsquo;s tradition Korean drumming ensemble. While I have dabbled in world percussion before, Korean drumming is totally new for me. I&rsquo;m playing the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggu\">Janggu</a>. It&rsquo;s really awesome getting back to the basics and learning a new instrument.</p></li>\n<li><p>Like a lot of other traditional percussion cultures, Korean drumming isn&rsquo;t written down. The beats and rhythms are simply taught by ear or example. I have found however, that there&rsquo;s an enjoyable amount of 3-over-2&rsquo;s and 4-over-3&rsquo;s in this tradition.</p></li>\n<li><p>I&rsquo;m glad I joined NYURI. The ensemble is surprisingly social compared to other student clubs. After each rehearsal, the members go out to dinner and hangout for the rest of the night. People always say that it&rsquo;s hard making friends at NYU. This is true to some extent, but through this group, it was a breeze.</p></li>\n</ul><p>That&rsquo;s all I have for now.

Every Sunday, all-semester-long, students are allowed free reign inside every foodie’s paradise (for a measly meal swipe). What sorts of wonders might one find within the walls of this dining hall? Too many to count, honestly, but here are some of the finest of them all:</p><p><small><i>(And, yes, all the GIFs depict actual, mouth-watering food found at Palladium.)</i></small><br/><b><br/></b></p><h2>Chocolate Fountain</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/7f61f047a21c45f60c418d82ff95bb60/tumblr_inline_nwf97mHdpB1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Arguably the crown jewel of Palladium Brunch, the rich milk chocolate fountain is accompanied by fruit, pretzel sticks, and marshmallows. What else do you need, really? (UGH. We’re already so hungry and this is only the beginning of this post!)<br/></p><!-- more --><h2>Fruit Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/9b6230d563196e76561daf5418b6eb4a/tumblr_inline_nw5yrdEAYr1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>For a healthier option that is nonetheless delicious, Palladium’s got your back: grapes, cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberries are all available by the bowl (and, yes, you can mix and match!). Whipped cream optional, though we highly recommend it.<br/><br/></p><h2>Milkshake Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/c804edefa465162788f3bffbd6d4ba80/tumblr_inline_nw5yr5EydA1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Well, it does <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGL2rytTraA\">bring all the boys to the yard</a>. Palladium’s shakes come in traditional vanilla, strawberry, or chocolate. Drinking only one is quite a challenge — thankfully, we can always come back for more.<br/><br/></p><h2>Eggs Benedict</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/ed656162a62ea13ef25a2275de425955/tumblr_inline_nw5yqveOhc1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Served plain, with salmon, or with Canadian bacon, it doesn’t matter which one you pick (or how many) because they’re all amazing. They’re a nice touch of classic brunch, but in a dining hall filled with all of your friends.<br/><br/></p><h2>Lox and Bagel Bar</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/8c1e16db4dbe9b81d91adee9eb2b838c/tumblr_inline_nw5yqhoGTh1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>Yeah, it’s NYC, you can get a great bagel anywhere. But we’ll bet Palladium beats your local bagel shop when it comes to the fixings. You can get these bad boys with cream cheese, tomato, capers, and some fine salmon, obviously.<br/><br/></p><h2>Dessert Table</h2><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/e09351c75b6a5aaa7b9f1ad8493d6228/tumblr_inline_nw5ypy75Kb1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure><p>With a tableful of mouth-watering eclairs, cannoli, cupcakes, cheesecakes, and many, many more, it’s hard to control ourselves. Good thing the gym’s downstairs, right?</p><p>There’s much more to be enjoyed, of course, which is why Palladium Brunch is famous for being the best of NYU Dining, and why we come back every hungry Sunday morning. Who needs NYC’s awesome brunch spots when we get all of this for a meal swipe?

Students must request special access to research in the stacks, located on the third floor of NYU’s Bobst library. Many of the volumes are old and rare, and everyone’s so careful with them that you can’t even bring a pen with you, lest ink bleed onto the pages.</p><p>The Marion Nestle Food Collection is just one small part of the Fales Library, acquired by NYU in 2001 from the private collection of Cecily Brownstone. She was an Associated Press food journalist and friends with James Beard, one of the most famous cookbook authors of the 20th century.</p><p>Everything from cookbooks to nutritional guides finds its home in these stacks. The 12,000-odd volumes from Brownstone are annotated in her own hand, many of them also inscribed by their respective authors. The rest of the books are just as interesting. “At first I thought these stacks weren’t all that different from other academic libraries, but as I learned more I started to appreciate how unique it was,” said Kendall Levison, one student who visited the collection.<br/></p><p>Not least among these robust personalities is the director of the Fales Library, Marvin Taylor. He’s helped grow the collection into what it is today – one of the largest food collections in America. With contributions from Conde Nast, Ladies’ Home Journal, and Café des Artistes, it now spans over 60,000 volumes.<br/></p><p>Taylor is filled with interesting tidbits of trivia about the history of the food collection, as well as the food scene here in New York City. He describes Cecily Brownstone as a “piece of work,” and refers to the surprising number among the cooking community of the 20th century who were queer as the “gay cooking mafia.”</p><p>What really stands out is Taylor’s passion for all this knowledge. “I wasn’t really excited about the history behind cookbooks before Marvin started talking about them,” said Sydney Maynard, another visiting student to the collection.</p><p>And he clearly knows what he’s talking about: He can name the title of Irma Rombauer’s biography, “Stand Facing the Stove,” taken from a common line in her book “The Joy of Cooking.” “It seems silly, but this book was first published during the Great Depression,” explained Taylor. “Middle-class housewives were cooking their own food for the first time, so even the simplest tasks had to be explained.”</p><p>“It was cool to learn the history of cookbooks and the sociological insight they give,” said Elana Rubin, another student. Books always say a lot about the people reading them, after all.<br/></p><p>All of this flavorful history helps spice up the initially boring-seeming stacks until there seems to be magic amongst the towering shelves. With books of all shapes, sizes, and colors, the smell of old paper perfuming the air, and Marvin Taylor as your guide, the food collection is an enlightening experience that teaches you how food has divided and brought together people of different times, places, and societies.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131646038488,"NoteCount":8,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z5n2By1wcjo7O","DateString":"2015-10-21","Text":"<p>When I tell people I graduated college at 21, they say, “Oh, wow.

She first came\nto America in 1963 to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago\n(SAIC). After graduation, she moved to New York City, where she still lives and\nworks.<br/></p><p> In <i>Deadend Street </i>(1978),\nthe viewer is greeted with an unusual pairing of images: Two photographic canvases\ndepicting a street under a railway are paired with two canvases painted black. The\ncenter of the piece remains hollow, drawing the viewers in. What continues to\nsurprise the viewers upon close inspection of the work is the replication of\nthe texture of the two depicted streets on to the adjacent black canvases. The\nblack canvas next to the wet street is glossy, whereas the one next to the dry\nstreet has a matte texture. The empty central panel balances the understated\ntrompe l’oeil effect formed as a result of this optical structure.</p><p> The blurring of boundaries, characteristic of the period and\nseen in many of the works in the Grey Art Gallery’s exhibition <i>For A New World to Come: Experiments in\nJapanese Art and Photography, 1968-1979</i>, is integral to the understanding\nof the work and its innovative spirit. The images of the street form the\nphotographic element, while the texture of the canvases and the framing of the\nwork have a sculptural touch. The painterly quality of the piece with its\ncritique of the medium of painting–the emptiness in the center creates a space\nthat painting has traditionally occupied–brings forth the question, “Is this a\nphotograph, a sculpture, or a painting?” and the answer is that it is in fact\nall three.</p><p> <i>For A New World to\nCome: Experiments in Japanese Art and Photography, 1968-1979,</i> is currently\non view at New York University’s Grey Art Gallery through December 5, 2015.

But with midterms piling on, bundling up in our <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://nyubook.collegestoreonline.com/ePOS?this_category=11&amp;store=209&amp;listtype=begin&amp;form=shared3%2fgm%2fmain%2ehtml&amp;design=209\">NYU sweaters</a> and clutching our hot coffee cups to keep warm is the least of our worries.</p>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1aPvwW4\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/63d5811286fdb6fc92d58319c7bdd8bb/tumblr_inline_nvzewslk911ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"232\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Halloween and midterms might fall in the same month, but only one of the two should leave you at your wit’s end. In any case, we’ve got some tricks and treats to help you get through midterms season painlessly.</p><!-- more -->\n\n<br/><br/><h2>1. Plan your time</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1fSuFJ7\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/b2ddb37348d70775bf458174e0b74861/tumblr_inline_nvzey6Lnh11ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Studying for midterms is pointless if you don’t know when they are! Buy a planner or even use your phone’s calendar app to keep all your dates straight. Know when things should be done and finish them by those dates.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Plan out your day hour-by-hour the night before, so no time is ever wasted.</p><br/><h2>2. Figure out what pumps you up and keeps your mood high</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1uqm9ru\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"262\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/faf5cd6881d961383f0263f818188275/tumblr_inline_nvzfahk5Bl1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"262\"/></figure></a><br/><p>If you’re going to study for a couple hours, you might as well get pumped for it! A happy brain is a productive one, so set yourself up for hours of productivity. Want to go for a walk? Do it! Want to have a dance party? Dance away! Feel like doodling or cooking? Go for it! (Just don&rsquo;t forget to buckle down afterwards.)<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Kill two birds with one stone and head out on a fun <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/130337465766/14-things-to-do-above-14th-street\">adventure above 14th Street</a> or check something off your <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/hashtagnyu/nyu-bucket-list/\">NYU Bucket List</a>.</p><br/><h2>3. Organize your tasks</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1OYWtd4\"><figure data-orig-width=\"365\" data-orig-height=\"215\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/249e9ecf9c4baffa08cf805cc147688d/tumblr_inline_nvzezyMTds1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"295\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Make lists of all the things you need to do, then break down the big tasks into multiple small tasks so goals seem easily achievable. The more that gets done, the more accomplished you’ll feel (and the better you’ll do)!<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Gain some momentum by including trivial tasks on your to-do list — like eating a snack or taking a shower — so you have more to cross off.</p><br/><h2>4. Get rest</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/VwHD4i\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/ff70146a025d7b7db1e9600b3d5de255/tumblr_inline_nvzf6nhY6v1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"250\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Whether you have midterms or not, you should always be getting a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/98471321896/7-sleep-protips-to-power-you-through-the-semester\">refreshing night of sleep</a>. Pulling an all-nighter to study for that exam might sound like a great idea, BUT IT’S NOT. Your body and mind are trying to tell you they’re at their limit, so don’t push it! You need that beauty sleep to wake up feeling and looking flawless.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Don’t hesitate to take a 20 minute nap if you’re dozing off midday. Naps can be just as important as sleep if you really need it. (Just be sure to set that alarm… or maybe two?)</p><br/><h2>5. Clean up your workspace</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1S904bU\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"277\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/baa25c009fdf654febc9d0996fe51cc6/tumblr_inline_nvzf2nlbMk1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"277\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Feng Shui 101: a cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. Clear out old papers, trash, and any unnecessary things from your desk to maximize your productivity zone. (This includes removing any possible distractions from the area, too.)<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Take time to tidy up not just before you work, but afterwards as well. That way, you can jump right into your next study session without headaches.</p><br/><h2>6. Shake it up</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1JWpgyo\"><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"132\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/65460789a2cb67fa9a104f3d450b4130/tumblr_inline_nvzoxgwvL91ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"269\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Don’t always study in the same spot. Make things interesting for yourself AND your brain by changing up your test-prep location every once in awhile. Keeping your brain on its toes will keep it fresh for reviewing material.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> We’ve got a starter list of some of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foursquare.com/hashtagnyu/list/places-to-study\">best places on and near campus to buckle down and get to work</a>.</p><br/><h2>7. Work in and out of study groups</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1jj99Q5\"><figure data-orig-width=\"360\" data-orig-height=\"202\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/6f5d1925d89ec2461c30090280d90eef/tumblr_inline_nvzfd0KeUI1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"281\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Some people prefer to work in groups. Others prefer to work alone. Decide which works best for you and — if you do like study buddies — pair up with people who work the same way as you.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Why not get the best of both worlds? Study solo to learn the material on your own, then teach it to your classmate or friend for review (and to share your overflowing knowledge)!</p><br/><h2>8. Listen to music</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1jjCV56\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"268\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/c53d665fdff60eb1fccfd15e07ae7f91/tumblr_inline_nvzp3rKhmN1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"268\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Warning: listening to music isn’t for everyone! For some people, having the ambient sound is better than silence. For others, the quiet is focusing. Decide which is best for you and stick with it. We’ve got a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://play.spotify.com/user/hashtagnyu\">nice range of songs</a> — from pumped-up playlists to soft music sets — to help you on your way.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Love music but find yourself singing along to your jam too often? Listen to film scores or instrumentals instead.</p><br/><h2>9. Take breaks</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1EtV0ae\"><figure data-orig-width=\"325\" data-orig-height=\"225\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/45a160d6e1b6f08d71b1b6a2aa46910b/tumblr_inline_nvzfekQhOI1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"346\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Sure, you’ve got a lot to do. But that doesn’t mean you have to work for hours non-stop! Pausing for regular breaks after 25 minutes of focused, hard work will make all the difference in boosting your efficiency and mood.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Briefly review the material you just studied before stepping away for a breather so your hard work doesn’t walk off with you.</p><br/><h2>10. Keep up your health</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1SiJBlq\"><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"130\"><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/51839b80c2011d1453727e86a139e7df/tumblr_inline_nvzp8fRjE71ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"265\"/></figure></a><br/><p>You don’t want to be sniffling and blowing your nose during your exams&hellip; It’s annoying for you and everyone in class. Plus, stress can seriously influence your overall health. Eat nutritious meals to power your study time with brain food, and always stay hydrated (that means water, not just coffee). Visit the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/student-health-center.html\">Student Health Center</a> or call the Wellness Exchange (repeat after us: 212-443-9999) if you need to talk something out.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip: </b>Grabbing a bite at an NYU dining hall? Get a fruit to-go and save it for your study sesh later.</p><br/><h2>11. Remain calm</h2>\n<br/><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://gph.is/1b7UtQo\"><figure data-orig-width=\"389\" data-orig-height=\"185\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/78f4afdb1fc244304b851e65983d9bd4/tumblr_inline_nvzpalNy361ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"238\"/></figure></a><br/><p>Midterms will be over before you know it (and finals begin&hellip;). If you’ve followed these tips, worked hard, and tried your best, you have nothing to worry about.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> Don’t forget to treat yo’self once it’s all over. You did it! You made it through in one piece. Now go order some Insomnia Cookies and catch up on all those TV episodes you missed.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131163153564,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZxGjlo1w9xkIS","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":"<p>10/13/15 - Jen getting real sassy as usual with her fiesty Latina self during a long overdue catchup Skype! 📞👭</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131156740435,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZD5AXy1w9ZGbJ","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":131153966264,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZJ1qWn1w9OhIu","DateString":"2015-10-14","Text":"<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/228287222&amp;color=57068c&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe>\n\nOn this week&rsquo;s episode of <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/weeklyrefresh\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly Refresh</a>, <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/keenan-kush\" target=\"_blank\">Keenan</a> and <a href=\"http://wnyunews.org/tagged/james-russo\" target=\"_blank\">James</a><a></a> are joined by Sergey for the first time since their pilot episode!

Why? Because the dorm’s wifi has gone down. And then IT came to fix it. And then it got even worse. The RAs keep reminding us to use the big computers upstairs on the fourth floor, which is fine, incovenient, but whatever. </p><p>Actually my friend figured out how to get wifi in his room by restarting the router. I did this last night and it worked. Seriously, IT couldn’t figure this out?</p><p>But I digress.</p><p>Today, I went to a student cafe I love called Cafedu, which is about 40 minutes away from the dorm. And for the first time ever, THEY ALSO DON’T HAVE WIFI. I’m already mad because I traveled all the way there, so I decide to go try McDonald’s down the street. THE WIFI ALSO DOESN’T WORK. At this point, I’m so pissed I go to “Osadni Hub”, the basement across the courtyard from the dorms the school put wifi in for us to study. They didn’t think about adding lights, but whatever, you can’t win with NYU.</p><p><br/></p><p>The reason I’m so pissed is because I’ve been having a terrible week to begin with, and midterms didn’t even start yet. But this reminds me of a bigger issue that my school never seems to GET.</p><p>There’s a great essay by Virginia Woolfe (I’m not well read, I read this for class once), called “A Room of One’s Own”, in which Woolfe says women needs opportunities which they don’t have which is why they don’t succeed. They don’t have a room for them just to focus on what they want and think creatively.</p><p>THIS SAME IDEA APPLIES TO COLLEGE STUDENTS. </p><p>When we complain to the administration that we don’t have this or that, it feels like the administrators don’t understand the validity of our complaints. Yes, some of it is because we are spoiled privilege rich kids, but on the other hand it’s because we need to feel comfortable so we are able to focus and study. When there’s no wifi, we’re not just mad because we can’t access social media, we’re mad because it hinders our studies- especially mine, because I have yet to be at a school with a decent library. I depend on online sources. When you give us alternative places to get internet access, they don’t understand it’s not a conducive study environment. That’s why I’m willing to travel 40 minutes to a student cafe so I can focus more on my work. </p><p>But then they assume we’re just being lazy people. I’m sure men thought women were being whiny too for wanting to do more than cooking, and that doesn’t mean cooking laundry.</p><p>Facilities should be a priority for students. Student well being in general should be more of a focus.</p><p><br/></p><p>The school says that IT will be back on Wednesday to fix our wifi again. Thanks for wasting a week of me being able to quickly check something online in my room, reply to an email from the school, or even fucking skype in comfort and not in a public area. I’m one of those people who need to feel alone and have it quiet to study. It’s not just about having wifi, it’s about the terrible alternatives given.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130950604591,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z82L_p1vzGwSl","DateString":"2015-10-11","Text":"<p>Doodles from the aerobics room</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130946428336,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vz0_sm","DateString":"2015-10-11","Text":"<p>When it comes to Bobst, we love to hate it but can&rsquo;t live without it.

The repeated rhythmic cells wove together nicely, and a cohesive foundation in that regard paved the way for a very clean reading, though one wished occasionally for a bit more intensity, particularly in the strings.</p><p>Halfway through the work, the haze of sound thinned, revealing the timbres of the individual instrumental sections before returning to the sound-world of the first section, but not without allowing the winds, particularly principal flutist DeShaun Gordon King, to shine. Pianist Hakyong Park and the percussion section ended the work on a very cinematic note, the percussion almost inaudible at the last.</p><p><b>Bela Bartok</b>’s Viola Concerto (1945), along with his Third Piano Concerto, was the last piece he ever worked on; he actually died before finishing his draft of the score, and the concerto was rescued from oblivion by his student and close friend Tibor Serly as well as his commissioner, legendary violist William Primrose. Although alternative editions exist, this one remains the most commonly performed. In three movements, it runs approximately twenty minutes in this edition.</p><p>Violist Fang Han was frankly astonishing; nearly note-for-note perfect, she left the audience stunned. Her sensitivity was particularly appreciated in the pristine, prayerlike opening of the second movement, while her bite was ferocious in the beast that is the third movement. The orchestra suffered from some ensemble issues, particularly in the middle of the cadenza-like passage in the first movement, which features low string and brass interjections between which the viola spits out virtuosic chords and harmonics. </p><p><b>Dmitri Shostakovich</b>’s Symphony No. 9 in E-Flat Major (1945), unlike other famous Symphony No. 9′s, is a humorous work, full of gaiety and a bit of biting sarcasm, although it reveals a darker side in the fourth movement, a stark <i>Largo</i>. </p><p>There was an interesting observation to be made at the beginning of the first movement; while the individual string sections played very well with themselves, they seemed to have difficulty hooking on rhythmically with each other. Piccolo player Charles Page quickly patched things up, however, with a confident sound that hardly betrayed the difficulty of the writing. The second movement began with clarinets; principal Ki-Deok Park was contemplative and solemn in great contrast to the preceding music. The sonority of the strings was lush and dark with great blend, though the first violins suffered a grave episode of rhythmic confusion in a section solo that seemed to have an eighth note disconnect from the front stand to the last.</p><p>The third movement, a <i>Presto</i> that featured some ricochet action from the first violins, was solidly the highlight of the night in terms of string playing; the strings, perhaps galvanized by the prior movement, were wholly unified and as agile as ever. The brass were somewhat unbalanced, with the trumpets struggling to be heard and the trombones and tuba easily audible. The flutes were again an excellent-sounding section, adding sparkle and flair with their multitude of runs. The end of that movement went <i>attacca</i> into the next, introduced by deep brass tones reminiscent of the Mussorgsky-Ravel <i>Catacombs</i> (from Pictures at an Exhibition) that led into a long recitative for bassoon. Bassoonist Jarrett Grempel filled the hall with an intense, rather bright timbre that tended a bit sharp at times. As he led into the final movement, also an <i>attacca </i>transition, his sound warmed up and intonation stabilized. The <i>Allegretto-Allegro </i>was maneuvered smoothly, lackadaisical and more than a little bit neurotic. The playing was excellent, without hiccups, and an end to the concert that left more than a couple with grins on their faces.  </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130856821781,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlNfuq1vthAGL","DateString":"2015-10-10","Text":"<p>【演出日記10-09-2015】</p><p><br/></p><p>今天演完了2015 Fall的第一場NYU管弦樂團表演。</p><p><br/></p><p>這學期感覺做很多事真的都得心應手許多。適應真的是一件很重要的事啊！還記得以前在國北，大二吹展覽會之畫的慘狀。到紐約後，某次排練，我突然頓悟一件事：不論你覺得自己吹得好不好，大膽、有自信的吹出來，結果都不會差到哪去。美國人替我驗證了這個例子許多次。認識我的人都知道，我在表演的時候很容易緊張，我經常思考，我到底是不是舞台型的人。其實我很愛站在舞台上的感覺，但緊張總是屢屢將我打敗。<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>我以前真的很討厭吹樂團的Solo，我希望我可以當第二部，偶爾吹吹英國管Solo就很開心了。今天我打破了自己的框架，吹了一些Solo，覺得自己還不賴（？）我真心喜歡吹樂團。從國一懵懂的被阿花指定為首席後，莫名的有一種熱情想要以樂團為第一目標的職業。當然愈長大愈覺得還有很長的路要走，我在舞台上還不夠穩定，不夠有耐心。</p><p>倘若未來真的幸運地成為某個職業樂團的Oboist，此身無憾！</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130841471786,"NoteCount":23,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vsmcig","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>Whether you’re in NYC or abroad, we  seeing you document the NYU experience with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/instaNYU?src=hash\" target=\"_blank\">#<b>instaNYU</b></a>: <a title=\"http://bit.ly/1gKSvsP\" href=\"http://t.co/IpWKCNPoNK\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1gKSvsP </a> <br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130838774499,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQh6Ij1vscKBZ","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<blockquote><p>His name is <b>JESSE ST.

He likes to do impromptu singing and dancing and he’s very unapologetic. Acting like this makes people take a step back from him and even though he knows it’s a problem he doesn’t want to change the way he is for anyone. His parents have tried to talk to him about it but it has led to angry arguments and never anything good. He dreams about performing on a big stage someday and have tons of fans adore and love him which is a way of him to cope with feeling so alone. <br/></li><li>He can seem very distant to people but he’s really just afraid of getting close to anyone, due to being a lonely kid and having trouble making friends all his life. He doesn’t really know how to act “normal” in front of others and always seems like he owns the world. His closest friends are those from his childhood that stuck with him and he misses them a lot. He likes to dress casually in darker colors but he still cares about looking good and having a fashionable style. </li><li>Jesse isn’t the smartest person in the world; in fact he’s struggling to make it in college at all. He feels like he’s doing his best but in reality he’s not. He spends a lot of time practicing his voice instead of doing homework or following up on what is happening in the classes. He can be very lazy when it comes to school but the opposite when it comes to his so called future on Broadway that he can’t stop dreaming about. He also enjoys taking pictures of the outside and going on long walks to get a good view or scenery. It relaxes him. </li><li>He secretly likes the idea of having a soulmate and the thought of it makes him feel less lonely. He grew up questioning his sexuality as he found himself attracted to both guys and girls but he has never been able to explore these feelings. Both because he’s too much in love with himself and because his parents doesn’t like the idea of Jesse being with a guy. He’s still hiding these feelings and only truly shows who he is to the people he’s closes to. </li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Jesse has semi-long curly brown hair and with deep blue eyes. He likes to wear dark colors like grey and black and rarely other colors. He’s very fashionable and shops expensive brands and how he looks is very important to him.

JAMES</b>. He is 18 years old, and originally from <b>SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA</b>. He’s currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with Sam Evans for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li>The St. James family was a very open and accepting one; they wanted nothing but the best for their boys, but were happy as long as their children were doing something they loved. They offered their support through every situation and had their arms open to any friends or loves that their sons brought into their home. Because of such a loving atmosphere, it wasn’t incredibly difficult for Peyton to come out to Jesse and his parents when he was fourteen. If anything, Peyton was incredibly thankful because he knew how difficult coming out to your loved one’s could be for other people. Of his parent’s, Peyton has always been the closest to his mother - finding his love for the piano through his time spent with her on it’s bench.<br/></li><li>Because of some heavy asthmatic problems, Peyton refrained from a lot of physical activity through school - opting to join the book club and take piano lessons instead of playing any kind of sports. In a school so big, it was easy to be labelled a nerd or an outcast because of his lack of interest in athletics but because of his kind and witty personality, he had an easy time fitting in with most people in his class. While he loved hanging out with all different kinds of people, he preferred the company of a few close friends over a crowd and spent most of his free time with them at their homes or his own. </li><li>A running joke in the St. James household is the fact that the boys were both given ambiguous names. Their parents chose the names for the kids right after they learned of the pregnancy because they were so overjoyed and couldn’t wait to be parents. When they went in for the ultrasound to find out the gender of their twins, they were told that they were having girls. The names they’d chosen, ‘Jesse’ and &lsquo;Peyton’, fit well and they were happy with their choices. When, to their surprise, two boys were born they decided to stick with what they’d already chosen instead of choosing something that society would consider a generally male name. </li><li>While most eighteen year olds had no idea what they wanted to do with their future, Peyton had always known that he wanted to play music. He’d been playing the piano since he was five years old and singing in the high school choir all four years. So, when it came time to send in applications for colleges, Peyton was on top of sending his information to all of the top music schools in the country. While he didn’t exactly want to leave San Fransisco, his acceptance to NYU couldn’t be passed up. He’s incredibly excited to be starting his freshmen year in New York and even though it’s going to be a very heavy work load studying two majors - Performance Studies through Tisch and Piano Studies at NYU - he knows what he wants for his future and working hard isn’t going to be a problem for him.</li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Peyton isn’t incredibly concerned about what he wears, as long as it’s comfortable and not overly complicated. He usually keeps his hair short on the sides, longer on top and fairly messy - opting to gel the top if he hasn’t just rolled out of bed or has to look decent for a performance. He very rarely lets it grow out much longer than his ears. There isn’t a touch of dye in it, preferring to keep it brown. Eventually he’d like to have more tattoos, but right now he only has a small treble clef behind his left ear and a small bass clef behind the right. He got them when he turned eighteen in a small act of rebellion. Because it’s frowned upon for performances, Peyton stays away from a lot of piercings; having just one stud in each ear. Typically, he sticks to plain t-shirts, button ups, flannel and fitted jeans with oxfords or combat boots. Peyton wears contacts primarily, but occasionally wears glasses if he was too lazy to put his contacts in that morning.</div></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130834744871,"NoteCount":4,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vsMyOd","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>Introducing the NYU Tandon School of Engineering​! <a title=\"http://bit.ly/1LdIAZ7\" href=\"http://t.co/cGkWI9RGc8\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/1LdIAZ7 </a> <br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130831981719,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vsCPoN","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>(by Sydney Kuo) - Summer in Paris - <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/summer-sessions/summer-abroad/programs.html\"><b><i>Go there</i></b></a><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130830749644,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vs7i-C","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>(by Ryann McQuaid) - Summer in Dublin - <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/admissions/summer-sessions/summer-abroad/programs.html\"><i><b>Go there</b></i></a><br/></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130829967914,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z9WcQj1vs4k8g","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p><i>“To commemorate my time in Italy/Europe, I created an Instagram inspired \nby Murad Osmann&rsquo;s Instagram (@muradosmann) of his following his \ngirlfriend around the world.

They brought me and a senior analyst who graduated from NYU in 2012 to mingle with the interviewees in the lobby while they waited for their turn. We were supposed to answer any questions they had about the company, the job, give advice, etc. I wasn’t actually interviewing anyone, they literally just brought me to spend half the day chatting with nervous af college kids lol. </p><p>But <i>wow</i> it was like deja vu. I can’t believe I was in their shoes two years ago. I remember when I was a senior, a lot of the companies that came to do OCR also brought recent NYU alumni to network with the interviewees. At the time, I thought, “<i>Maybe they&rsquo;re secretly scrutinizing how we&rsquo;re acting in the waiting room and they’re going to report it back to the interviewers. I better make a good impression on them too.</i>” <b>Hahahaha.</b> I actually have pretty much have no say in who is getting invited back for a second round interview. The second round is also the last round, aka our “Superday.” That’s when the company is going to invite all of the students who they liked from yesterday to come to our office and meet with all of the managing directors one by one, then do a case interview, and then take them to dinner (and drinks if they are 21). Also there will be students from other schools like Columbia and Fordham and Baruch, and wherever else we did on-campus interviews. And then after Superday, they will decide who to give job offers to. </p><p>Anyways, it’s just so interesting being on the other side of things this time. And it makes me SOOOOOOO grateful I am not going through OCR right now lol. I do feel a little awkward helping my company out with recruiting season because of the fact that I’m simultaneously job-searching for myself under the table. But at least I wasn’t lying when I was telling the seniors that I do think this is a great place to start your career!!!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130810628875,"NoteCount":5,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZROwej1vqwyiB","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>October 1, 2015.</p><p>Adventure inbetween classes.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130809883130,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZROwej1vqu6dw","DateString":"2015-10-09","Text":"<p>Berlin. September 25-28 2015.</p><p>I love Berlin. It is a mixture of young and old. There is so much history there, most of it sad, but it is quite an experience. This was my first trip in Europe, outside of the Czech Republic so you can say I was more than a little excited.</p><p>Our friend, Ericsson, came with us and it was great! He is the best third wheel. We now have a thing that when we go places with him we have to take a selfie of the three of us. We did this in Berlin and in Vienna.</p><p>When we first got to Berlin we took a bus to our Airbnb from the bus station. We met a very nice German lady, young and half German half Colombian. She let us know what sights to see on such a short trip. </p><p>As soon as we got off the bus Ericsson realized that he dropped his wallet on the seat! We thought it was a goner for the longest time. Not too long ago I was going through my Facebook messages and noticed an unread message from someone I didn’t know. It turned out to be the lady we met on the bus! She told me she has Ericsson’s wallet and wants to send it to him! It was a miracle and we are forever grateful to her.</p><p>I recommend visiting Kreuzberg while in Berlin. It is the “young” section of town, like Brooklyn. The variety of food is outstanding and the shops are all hipster which is appealing.</p><p>Also, I ate meat :o I had little bites of whatever the boys had ordered: currywurst, veal meatballs, and some beef thing. All very good and I have slo-mo videos of myself trying each thing lol. </p><p>I hope to try a little bit of meat in each place that I visit, just to experience the food of different cultures. I will still continue to be a veggie, though!</p><p>I want to go back to Berlin; there are so many museums to go in, so many restaurants to eat in, so many bookstores to search in. I also have to see the Berlin Philharmonic.

For starters, as Ken and his amazing grad students corrected me, they aren’t working on “virtual reality”, but rather “Future Reality.” For them, this four dimensional simulation existence is our best guess at what living in the future will be like.</p>\n<p>So, the only reasonable thing to do was try it out. First off, some volunteers stapped on some equipment, that is to say: anklets, bracelets, and head gear, along with a remote control. Once the Oculus is on, they are no longer standing in the room I’ve pictured below, but a well lit, empty room with wood floors and tall ceilings. Although the two participants can’t see us, they can see one another (as stick figures of course), and if they want to reach out and grab their what they see of their counterpart’s hand (in future reality) they can (in actual reality).</p>\n<p>Then, once they are accustomed to their surroundings, the users then can start experimenting with their surroundings. With this magical wand of a remote control, you can draw in three dimensions, and it can be a collaborative effort with the other user together you can draw and build in 3d. You can walk through each others drawings like a ghost, and change the color of your masterpiece.</p>\n<p>Then if that wasn’t cool enough, you can pull off all your gear and prance on over to the other lab where the Vive is also hooked up to the same simulation, except now you are a giant overlooking those other two schmoes in the other room as they draw and dance and attempt to become accustomed to their new surroundings. The next step in future reality is making it possible for you to make drawings in their world from the other room (and maybe freak them out and play with them a bit, haha). But even if it isn’t interactive yet, if I believed that I was truly in a different room when I put on the Oculus Rift, the visuals on the Vive are a million times more realistic.</p>\n<p>Once we all went through those simulations, Tom Small from YouTube and Google came to show us his new #360video documentary <a href=\"https://youtu.be/teB-Icrog6E\">“Kissed by a Wild Mountain Gorilla”</a> on gorillas in Congo. Not only did we get a chance to look eye to eye with gorillas - to the point where you want to pull the Google Cardboard as far away from you face as possible because you don’t want to be pulled to shreds by a Silverback - but we also got an inside look at the native peoples who’s main source of income is the tourism and foreign interest in safari.</p>\n<p>I don’t know about all these Virtual Reality horror games I keep hearing about, but this was unbelievable! This is what dreams are made of, but actually!</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"960\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img

I would address the mailman by name and he’d ask me how school was going. Whenever I went out for a bagel and a coffee, I could expect the same man to be crouching behind a newspaper at a corner table. His name was Bob and he once asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up.</p><p>Just the other day, my dad texted me: “I just ran into Danny from Hang Tai. He asked about you. I told him you were in college and they flipped out.” I wouldn’t recognize the owner of our local Chinese restaurant if I bumped into him on the street, but apparently he knows me.</p><p>It reminds me of the beginning of <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/36034/36034-h/36034-h.htm\" target=\"_blank\"><i>White Nights</i> by Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the Gardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those I had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year. They, of course, do not know me, but I know them. I know them intimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am delighted when they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud.</p></blockquote><p>There is no such familiarity here. People stand in elevators and do not look at each other. I come to the same spot at the library nearly every day, yet I never encounter the same people. I take the subway at the same time every day I go to work, but the cars are filled with strangers, ear budded and unsmiling.</p><p>My college’s lack of an actual campus makes it nearly impossible to formulate a sense of community in this overwhelmingly large place. I came here craving anonymity, though I suppose I didn’t know what it would actually feel like. But it’s novel and I like it. I like that I can walk down the street on a bad hair day without fearing that I’ll bump into someone I know. I like meeting new and interesting people, even if I don’t find them in the same spots every day. And maybe, over time, I will become accustomed to meeting the same people, and I will study their faces and interpret their emotions as though they were my nearest friends.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130512982528,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZM6YRj1vZBX80","DateString":"2015-10-05","Text":"<p>This  week was a little different from previous. While last week was a sort of busy one with the arrival of the pope happening, this week was a return to the usual work pace. Sometimes I wonder if the office is a bit over staffed in the Graphics department. Often there&rsquo;s about 6 people in that room including myself and Pratik. Often we&rsquo;ll get a few logos and graphics to make, but usually it seems like most of the work is done by 1pm. Though this rules gets proven otherwise due to how ever-changing a news show can be. The show itself airs at 3 so, any number of things can change til then. Stories might get cut or suddenly added. They might not be pleased with what was done or have a minor suggestion that we&rsquo;ll have to accommodate. This part of the job I like, because it feels fast paced and exciting. Not to say that everything else is boring, because it&rsquo;s anything but that. But, a little surprise alway gets the blood flowing I feel.</p><p>The other interesting thing to take place this week is the loss of my work station. See, the graphics department consists of these computers against the wall which are called work stations. Everyone on the job that day gets a work station and go about their tasks. Simple, right? Now my work station might be what you call a worn out one. The station uses Mac computers, like most graphics teams seem to use today, and mine was a bit of an older model. The programs were dated, and it was somewhat slow. But it worked. Up until last week I got my work done on it so I had no real complaints. This week however, the computer crashed. Which was unfortunate, because most of the work I was doing, was kept locally.  It kind of sucks cause that&rsquo;s quite a bit of time and effort  lost. Not everything I made was for the show, but I suppose that&rsquo;s the risk I took for not having my folder on the network drive.</p><p>Well, with a computer now gone, this meant I was back to working with Pratik at the same computer. It did mean we ended up talking a bit more, but like I said, with work being more stretched out until crunch time, it felt perfectly fine. We still got all of our work done with about two hours to spare. Usually I just use that extra time to check out the news or just pick a project to do to brush up on my skills. It&rsquo;s one of the downsides at working in a  broadcasting station for a news network. You can&rsquo;t really just work on what&rsquo;s coming up. The news isn&rsquo;t planned so carefully because well, it&rsquo;s the news. Something is always happening so we always need to be prepared to adjust and give what&rsquo;s more interesting. Which is more than I can say for the non-stop political coverage of Donald Trump by other news shows.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130501378502,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZnxdMt1vYVG76","DateString":"2015-10-04","Text":"<p><!-- more --></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hc-ronicas.tumblr.com/post/126688216370/telling-a-new-tale\" target=\"_blank\">hc-ronicas</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Telling a New Tale</h2>\n<p>I will be arriving in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 10 (what!?!?) days!

Time feels like it’s gone by both sooo fast and also so slow at the same time. I feel like i’ve known people for such a long time, even though we’ve only been together for a month. Everything is really getting into full gear now. I had a paper due last week, an exam this week and two papers due next week. It’s starting to pile up and I have to take a moment to look back at the past month and think about everything that I did:</p><p>Welcome week was absolutely packed. So much happened in such little time. I really got to know about the school and everything that is offered here. There are so many opportunities here, but never enough time to take advantage of all of them. My main extracurricular focus is working for Washington Square News, which staff applications are coming out for pretty soon - so cross your fingers for me!</p><p>My floor has gotten incredibly close. We hang out all the time, and I’m pretty sure that we know each other more than any other floor. We’ve gone out basically every weekend and explored around the area. We went to see the lunar eclipse at the Brooklyn Bridge together last weekend. I think that it’s pretty great we have this community on our floor already. It’s hard to find some solid friends here at NYU, so having that built in community on our exploration floor is really such a relief. I know that even though I might not have a bunch of friends in all my classes, at least I’ll have my floor (which, the people on my floor are better than people in my classes to be honest, sorry). </p><p>Let’s see, what else has happened over this last month!? Well, I went to two fashion week shows! They were small but it was still a great experience and a fun way to start working for WSN. I went to Tia Cibani and Saga NYC. They were two very different but impressive shows in their own ways. Tia Cibani was this beautiful, very grounded presentation with light and festive designs that I could definitely see myself walking down the street in. Saga NYC was a great take on minimalism and monochromatism in an interactive presentation. I met some great people through it and hopefully it establishes who I am within the WSN community. Staff applications are live, so wish me luck there!</p><p>Technically I’ve been to four concerts now, but one of them was the Global Citizen Festival, which basically counts for like ten different concerts. Coldplay was there. Coldplay performed with Ariana Grande. Tori Kelly was there. Ed Sheeran was there. Ed Sheeran performed with Coldplay. Common performed. Common performed with Sting. Beyoncé was there. Beyonce and Ed Sheeran sang Drunk in Love together and I think my heart burst. Pearl Jam performed. Beyonce and Eddie Vedder sang Redemption Song. I died a second time. It was probably the most exhausting but best day every. Hugh Jackman and Stephen Colbert hosted the event, Leo DiCaprio was there, Michelle Obama, Bill Nye, Malala, Salma Hayek, the Gates’, the Bidens, Big Bird, Bono, Queen Reina, Prime Ministers of many countries, UN members and soooo many other people. Best. Day. Ever</p><p>I also went to Walk the Moon with Saint Motel and was super close. That was such a great concert and I love the setting of a show in the park. Central Park is one of my favorite places on the island. The air is so fresh and the sunset was a beautiful backdrop for the start of the show. Both were incredible performers and it was a wonderful night.</p><p>The past couple nights I pulled a concert double header. I went to Stromae on Thursday. He’s amazing. He is so passionate about his music, he’s a great dancer and performer and he brings so much heart to his shows. I love his music and it’s so great to see him reach this incredible achievement of filling up Madison Square Garden. Friday night, I went to the Neighbourhood, Bad Suns and Honey. That was probably one of the most insane concerts I’ve ever been to. The mosh pit was aggressive and kept swaying and I now know what it is like to be a sardine in a can. The Neighbourhood was soooo good live. Jesse pointed at me during the show, and I also nabbed a set list - I was a happy sardine.</p><p>There’s so much to come soon. I have to go into WSN to work on layout a bit and I have two papers due next week. Everyone is in the midst of midterms, so we can’t wait to get them over with and celebrate. We’ve got a lot of floor birthdays coming up, so this is going to be a lot of fun!</p><p>More adventures on the way!</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130416608027,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZBav1v1vTRuCR","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p>Rainy day blues cure = hookah + surprise bellydancer out at Falucka 💃🏻💥 you all missed it when she came out with a candelabra on her head #hookah #bellydancer #fun #dance #smoke #chill #rain #nyc #nyu #village #washingtonsquarepark #bleeker (at Falucka Lounge NYC)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130410339721,"NoteCount":6,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZiKHUy1vT3zs9","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p>My Brilliant Friend, Elena Ferrante (F, 50s, Met Museum bag, just starting the book, NYU ISAW lecture)</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130406396340,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zsy-yq1vSqx6q","DateString":"2015-10-03","Text":"<p><b>WHAT:</b> Dinner with 8 Strangers<br/><b>DATE:</b> Sunday, October 11<br/><b>TIME:</b> 6PM<br/><b>LOCATION:</b> East Village (around 1st Ave &amp; 6th St)</p><!-- more --><p><b>DETAILS: </b>This is an awesome opportunity in which you can enjoy a tasty meal in NYC with other awesome people who live in the Grad Halls (WSV &amp; StuyTown)!  We hope that this will give you an opportunity to meet someone new in a small group setting.  The event will take place at a BYOB Indian restaurant in the East Village and only requires a $5 copay. <b><a href=\"https://orgsync.com/102698/events/1232057/occurrences/2764229\" target=\"_blank\">RSVP Here</a></b>.</p><p>**It is a priority to make our events inclusive and ADA accessible.

He is 18 years old, and originally from <b>BURLINGTON, VERMONT</b>. He’s currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with _____ for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li> Born as one of two, Blaine Anderson came into the world as a wide eyed, fresh young face, ready to take on the world and all it offered. Or, so he thought, anyways. A young and ambitious child, Blaine considered himself the more driven of his brothers, and as soon as he was able to walk and talk, he put this ambition into overdrive immediately. Blaine was soon singing and dancing all around the house, enjoying a duet with his older brother, Cooper, on more than on occasion. His parents, Sophia and Bruce, were happy beyond all belief to see their children getting along — after all, three boys can be quite a handle full, but Blaine didn’t seem to mind. If he was with his family, then he was happy. <br/></li><li> Being raised in a loving household also helped Blaine believe that his dreams could come true. His mother, Sophia, was born and raised in Sorrento, Italy and she was a main proponent in Blaine’s confidence, and enthusiasm. His father, Bruce, was a suit and tie business man, though his demeanor was hardly serious. In fact, if anything, his father was the biggest goofball in the house. And when you’re living under the same roof as Cooper Anderson, that’s a hard title to beat. With his love of all things Christmas (right down to matching family Christmas sweaters) and off kilter sense of comedy, he and Blaine struck up a close relationship from a young age. Knowing that he had two people to rely on at all times was more than most kids his age could say, and Blaine never took his easy going connection with either one of them for granted. <br/></li><li>As Blaine aged, though, he started to notice differences about himself. While the other boys in middle school were focusing on girls, and how pretty they all seemed to look, Blaine couldn’t be bothered. Sure, girls were beautiful, and he could admire them from a distance, but he didn’t feel the need to kiss them, like his friends talked about. In fact, the more he let himself think about it, the more he realized that kissing his friends was more appealing. Boys were.. different, and Blaine admired the way their waists tapered down, and the way their muscles contracted and shifted under their skin. It was confusing, to say the least, and so, as any young boy would, he took to the internet. And, immediately, the internet gave back. Having something to call himself – gay – was settling, and Blaine felt the pressures of what other people say float off his shoulders with every passing day. At this age, he was still naive enough to think that maybe – just maybe – it wouldn’t matter. No one had said anything about it to him, anyways, and Blaine’s happy-go-lucky personality was a hard thing to target. He officially came out right before high school, during the winter of eighth grade. And while the initial reaction was pretty standard – his parents were ever supportive of whatever he wanted to do with his life, and whoever he wanted to love – the small bouts of hate began to rear their ugly heads. </li><li>The end of the year brought a Sadie Hawkins dance for the upperclassmen to celebrate their achievements, and Blaine – being who he was – invited along his friend, Lucas. The two had known each other for years, and Lucas was the only other out person at their school. Going together to show their support just made sense in Blaine’s mind, and once they were at the dance, Blaine discovered that his fleeting moments of worry were for nothing. It wasn’t until after the dance, when Blaine and his friend were waiting for their ride to take them home, that his fears became a reality. A hostile group of boys from the high school attacked them both, leaving Blaine and Lucas helpless on the concrete. Immediately, both were taken to the hospital, and after a few months of physical therapy, Blaine was pulled from public school and, instead, enlisted at a private boys boarding school, just an hour outside of their hometown. The isolation was hard, but the no bullying policy was unwavering, and Blaine found himself settling into his new atmosphere (and his new uniform) within the first couple of months. As a freshman, he didn’t try to approach any of the clubs on campus – he needed to keep his grades up in order to remain enrolled in the school, after all – but the competitive show choir caught his eye immediately. That passion he had for performing when he was little never diminished, and though his work with local community theaters had been stunted, due to his accident, his love of the arts certainly remained. As a sophomore, Blaine developed the courage to audition, and upon acceptance, finally fell into a group of people he could rely on, and people he felt he could relate to. His junior year, Blaine was put on the council, and during his time in an administrative position, Blaine led his team to two back to back National championships. </li><li>College was lurking around the corner, and Blaine’s eyes were easily on the best city to be in for people like him – New York. NYADA was his first choice, but his time spent off the stage due to his incident cost him a fair chance. So, instead, Blaine found himself at NYU: Tisch, a great alternative for people in the arts. There, he’s a theater major with a minor in music, and with his passion to succeed and his unwavering spirit, Blaine is sure that he’ll be able to make it to the top one day. He, of course, misses his brother, but he knows how strong Austin is after what he went through, and he’s positive that they’ll find a way to meet up again in the future, given their natural pull towards a career in music. </li></ul></blockquote><h2>CHARACTER AESTHETIC</h2><blockquote><div>Blaine’s style could easily be described as ‘preppy chic’. Growing up in a household that wasn’t exactly strapped for money meant that Blaine could splurge a little on his back to school clothing hauls. He prefers the tight fit of slacks over jeans, though he’s not against denim in the slightest. He often wears collared shirts, too – sleeve length doesn’t matter. Layering is also something Blaine’s known to do – in the colder months (or even the warmer months), Blaine tends to pair a polo shirt with a matching sweater vest. During the winter, thicker sweaters tend to be Blaine’s favorite, and though he won’t admit that he likes labels, Blaine’s top two choices for clothing stores are Brooks Brothers, and the GAP. His most notable feature is his bowtie – Blaine’s collection is expansive, and maybe borderline out of control. He wears one with every ensemble he pulls together, however, and he tends to match the patterns and colors with as much style as he can. His shoes are almost always Oxfords, though the warmer months tend to put Blaine in boat shoes – something he got accustomed to at a young age through the various country club visits he took with his Dad back in Vermont. He’s also got his Dad’s old watch on his left wrist at all times.\n\n<p>Physically, Blaine is easy to pick out among a crowd. He’s shorter than most males, standing at five feet, eight inches tall. His hair – while curly in it’s natural state – is always slicked back with a thick sheen of hair gel. When they’re left unattended to, Blaine swears he can turn people to stone with just a single look. It’s not very often that Blaine lets anyone see him in such a state. Due to his Italian roots on his mother’s side, Blaine’s skin is also easy to tan and color during the summer.</p></div></blockquote>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130366661659,"NoteCount":1,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZQh6Ij1vQTMGR","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<blockquote><p>Her name is <b>OPEN BERRY</b>.

He is 18 years old, and originally from <b>DENVER, COLORADO</b>. He’s currently a freshman at <b>NYU</b>, and has been paired with Kennedy Fabray for the project.</p></blockquote><h2><i>He is currently a <b>TAKEN CHARACTER</b>.</i></h2><blockquote><ul><li>Sebastian Smythe, and his twin, were born in Paris, France to Xavier and Adelaide Smythe. Their birth was rejoiced, though the novelty quickly wore off and, within weeks, Adelaide was back to her social functions while Xavier immersed himself in his work. Being a lawyer, his services were always in need and his lovely wife was more than willing to reap the benefits, such as top of the line nannies that worked around the clock to provide her children with excellent care. They had a need for nothing as they were given anything that they could possibly dream of having, even as infants.<br/></li><li>At the tender age of 6, Sebastian’s life was changed. The Smythe family uprooted and made the move to the states where Xavier’s spectacular skill sets were in much need. With the amount of money they were throwing at the Smythes, how could he think of saying no? Some would say that this was the start of Sebastian’s entitled – and somewhat petulant – behavior. Things changed almost drastically. From lavish parties and the city of love just beyond their doorstep to Denver, Colorado – middle America where they had no choice but to start over with no friends or family to assist them. Although money was abundant,  their nannies were far more strict, and deemed him undeserving of the treats he demanded, frequently putting up a great fuss until, inevitably, the nanny had no choice but to give him his much desired treat. Rather than discourage his behavior, it was Xavier that encouraged Sebastian to fight for what he wanted and to never take no for an answer. He wouldn’t know the impact that this lesson would have on Sebastian in later years.</li><li>No one could deny that Sebastian had a charismatic nature that drew people towards him and am innate ability to talk himself in (and out) of any situation. It was the one thing that made him so popular in school. Whether you loved him or hated him, you simply couldn’t stay away, and Sebastian reveled in all of the attention. Why shouldn’t he? After all, he fought for his social standing in school – with his straight A’s and ability to stand up to any who dared to see him as weak. And though he had money, it was something that he knew not to take for granted. His father taught him better than that. He could learn to survive without it, though he couldn’t deny himself the pleasure of indulging his own whims and spoiling himself as only a Smythe knew how.</li><li>Sebastian’s future had been planned out from the moment that he discovered his love of debate. There were no questions about what it was that he’d like to do when he could follow tradition. Sebastian was expected to follow in his father’s footsteps and he was fine with that. He looked up to Xavier and was more than pleased to one day be as respected and beloved as his father was among his friends and colleagues. All it took was one day, one moment, for Sebastian to begin questioning it all. – Sebastian’s sexuality had never been a topic of conversation among the Smythe family. There was no need with Sebastian showing up to events and parties with pretty girls hanging off his arm. Yet there was a part of himself that he was hiding. One which was discovered when his father walked in to find him in a half-dressed state with another boy. The conflicts that would arise from that moment would cause a sense of uncertainty to rise within Sebastian. Was his father really the type of man that he wanted to emulate when he was so quick to turn his back on his own child when faced with Sebastian’s bisexuality; just because it was something he didn’t entirely understand or accept?</li><li>It all came to a head when graduation neared and Xavier could no longer keep quiet his views of his son’s behavior. An ultimatum was made: if Sebastian were to forget about his little ‘experiment’ with other boys and no longer shame the Smythe name with his ‘despicable’ acts then Xavier would continue to fund not only Sebastian’s schooling, but would provide him with a hefty sum to keep him, and his future family comfortable. If not then Sebastian could consider himself cut off and disowned. Xavier would “not tolerate a son who chooses to be gay.” It didn’t take Sebastian long to make a decision. Xavier taught him to stand up for himself and that’s what he decided to do when he turned down his father’s money and chose to go to NYU, a city far from home where he could live his life, and find his true calling, whatever it may be. With the help of his mother, he found a way to pay his tuition, though Adelaide could hardly afford to anger her husband further by providing Sebastian with little more than some spare cash for books, leaving him in desperate need of money by the time classes were well underway.</li><li>The experiment was not something that Sebastian would have considered, under normal circumstances. He had no desire to involve himself with any one person in particular, especially one who would not be within a short driving distance. Yet it was the money, above all else, that made it difficult for him to say no.

At the end of the Faith Zone Training, every participant leaves feeling as though they can make a difference in their own community using the things they learned. Here are our Top Ten Tips for Multifaith Work that we recommend every student uses when taking their Faith Zone Training to the real world. </p><p>1. Check out our Principles of Multifaith\nEngagement:</p><p>          i.Reflect diversity, accounting for the complex\nand intersectional identities of our constituents.</p><p>          ii. Rooted in fact-to-face encounters and deep\nrelationship-building within and between communities and/or individuals.</p><p>          iii. Committed to social transformation and civic\nengagement (i.e. multifaith issue-based solutions to social problems such as\npoverty, prison industrial complex, human trafficking).</p><p>          iv. Focused on introspection and meaning-making as a\nway of understanding spirituality.</p><p>          v. Inclusive of and attentive to personal\nnarratives through intentional storytelling pedagogy, not just representative\nof religious creed.</p><p>          vi. Supportive of Integration of the whole student\nexperience throughout their academic and co-curricular development. </p><p>          vii. Supportive of coursework that promotes\nmultifaith leadership.</p><p>2. Create a safe space that encourages dialogue.\nApproach every conversation with a co-learner orientation.</p><p>3. Ask people about their personal practices. Not\nall people within a religious or spiritual community practice in the same way. </p><p>4. Don’t be afraid of making mistakes. Let those\naround you know that they can voice a concern if something you say offends\nthem. </p><p>5. Whenever possible, organizers should reflect the\ndiversity of those who will be participating in a particular event.</p><p>6. Events should be easily accessible and\ncomfortable for all potential participants. Some things to consider:</p><p>          i. Religious Holidays (available on Google\nCalendar)</p><p>          ii. Prayer times</p><p>7. At an event itself, ensure that the structure of\nthe event is inclusive. Some things to consider:</p><p>          i. Dietary needs such as Kosher, Halal, vegetarian,\nvegan etc. </p><p>          ii. Physical contact between genders</p><p>8. Create an environment where people feel safe\nmaking requests for religious and spiritual observance or practice. Make it\nclear that there will not be ramifications for making that request.</p><p>9. Use inclusive language to welcome students who\ndo not identify with a particular faith tradition or identify as atheist or\nagnostic.</p><p>10. Seek\nhelp or advice from Chaplains and GSL.</p><p>If you have any questions, please contact Ariel Ennis at ariel.ennis@nyu.edu.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130346880690,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Zsy-yq1vPHuwo","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130346666764,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZoE7Nm1vPH4iC","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>\n\n<b>Over the following week, as part of the first #NYULeadershipWeek, we will be featuring NYU students and alumni as they reflect on leadership:  </b> </p><p>Helping others near and far through acts small and large can\noften create ripples much greater than expected.

It is the skill of knowing how to bring out the best in others and\nmotivating many to work towards a communal goal. For me, leadership is </i><i>about coordination: piecing together the\ndifferent components and talents available so that the </i><i>sum is greater than its parts. Great leaders, in\nmy view, are those individuals with the ability to </i><i>admit their vulnerabilities and learn from those\nsurrounding them to strengthen their own </i><i>narratives as well as that of all those around\nthem. It is the characteristic of a person who </i><i>constantly takes on multiple perspectives and is\nable to use them accordingly.</i></p><p> <b>What has been your biggest leadership failure?\nAnd what did you learn?</b></p><p><i>Two failures in particular come to mind. One was\nwhen I was a good deal younger and was </i><i>responsible for managing individuals much older\nthan myself. Being so young, at the time I </i><i>didn’t realize the importance of setting a proper\ntone for the work environment and of the </i><i>nuances involved in coworker relations. Now, I\nhandle the same challenge by approaching each </i><i>situation uniquely and with humility. What I\nview as the more important failure however, is the </i><i>instance of having individuals being left behind\nwho I wasn’t able to reach out to or connect with on an individual level. For\nexample, if I see someone who after a program or meeting is sitting alone and\ndidn’t contribute, or wasn’t integrated into the larger group interaction or\nconversation, that for me is a leadership failure. It means that I wasn’t able\nto create an environment that was as  inclusive as it needed to be. That\nteaches me to think about the people on the fringes; how can I be mindful of,\nand attract those individuals?</i></p><p> <b>What is one word or idea that you seek to\nredefine by the end of your career?</b></p><p> <i>If I can work towards redefining people’s\nunderstandings of a single concept it would be that of </i><i>“shared humanity.” Once in college\n a highly educated peer who was serving the country in the armed forces\nresponded to a debate we were engaged in regarding national responsibility to\nrespond to overseas refugee crises, an issue even more relevant today. He\nstated something along the lines of “it’s not our problem, why should we be\nsucked into their mess?” That was devastating for me. I didn’t  think that\nyoung man was  a bad individual but so many people today would agree with\nhis stance. If I could just impart onto others this notion that we are tied to\none another no matter what small corner of the globe we may find ourselves in,\nwe are tied to each other by virtue of our humanity. When we understand how\npowerless we actually are in determining what circumstance we’re born into, it\nbecomes clear that to value your life over another’s by virtue of living in a\nplace that is better off or having access to certain resources, that is the\nworst type of arrogance possible. And if we can’t care for one another by\nsimple virtue of our shared humanity, then really, what are we trying to\naccomplish in life?</i></p><p><b>Please describe a defining moment in your life\nthat has shaped your values.</b></p><p><i>I believe the defining moment in my life was\nlosing my father after my high school graduation. Sometimes it takes a\nlife-changing event to make you ask yourself tough questions </i><i>about who it is you actually are? What type of\nperson do you want to be and what will it take </i><i>for you to get there? Unfortunately, our culture\nin the U.S., and in New York in particular is not </i><i>necessarily always conducive to self-reflection\nand mindful meditation and so I find that often </i><i>we rush through life without challenging our own\nbeliefs and practices and getting to the </i><i>core of why we do what we do. I think constant\nself-reflection is something we need to </i><i>encourage more, especially among young adults\nand adolescents.</i></p><p> <i>For me personally, when I had to face the hard\nreality of overcoming tragedy as I began college, </i><i>I realized that at some point I had to live my\nlife according to what I believed in. There’s no use </i><i>in having philosophies and moral judgments if\nyou’re not going to stand by them with your </i><i>actions. This has greatly shaped how I interact\nwith others to this day and my efforts to lead </i><i>genuinely, with integrity.</i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130340401453,"NoteCount":19,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZrCISo1vOvB4j","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>Upper East Side</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130337465766,"NoteCount":10,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vOj_Mc","DateString":"2015-10-02","Text":"<p>Of all the freshmen stereotypes, there is one that shines brighter than the infamous lanyard: not exploring the city beyond 14th Street.

She has an extensive background and record in governance, higher education, and community and political organizing.<b><br/></b></p><figure data-orig-width=\"254\" data-orig-height=\"253\"><img src=\"https://56.media.tumblr.com/3e7ea18437dc6fbfaa435e8795456825/tumblr_inline_nvicux1n9v1t25dex_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"254\" data-orig-height=\"253\"/></figure><p><b>How do you define leadership?</b></p><p><i>Early on, my time in the military and other challenging environments taught me what leadership is not: leadership is not individualistic, it’s not about prestige, power, or managing things or people merely to check boxes. Leadership to me is the living, holistic embodiment of values centered on inspiring others to be their best selves for positive influence and impact. In this vein, leadership to me is about community, integrity, respect.</i></p><p><b>What has been your biggest leadership failure? And what did you learn?</b></p><p><i>I find the paradox of leadership fascinating&ndash;something so often glorified and put on a pedestal, yet leadership is often a messy, challenging, isolating place to live. Many of the best leaders I know are ones who’ve known hardship, thus their fearlessness to jump in no matter the challenge, often leading the way out of passion for people, communities, or larger-than-life issues. My whole life I’ve been praised for “working under pressure, working well in stress” and certainly it’s a honed skill I know I have due to my life experiences. However, my biggest leadership failure has been not asking for help and not having boundaries between my work, and my self care. This continues to be a working challenge for me given my service-minded, community-driven style of leadership. More and more I’ve learned the glorification of productivity and pressure can result in a distorted assumption that leaders should be working under constant duress or else they aren’t truly committed to their cause, community, or  team. I’ve learned that if I don’t take care of myself, I can’t be my best self, and I can’t ask others to be theirs.</i></p><p><b>What is one word or idea that you seek to redefine by the end of your career?</b></p><p><i>An idea I seek to redefine has to do with dissent, differing opinions, and being okay with not being 100% right. In a time of great advancements we are still very much stagnant, even regressing, when it comes to our potential as a society. I attribute much of this to general, strengthening sentiment of individuals needing to never be wrong or vulnerability seen as a weakness. Many things in our lives are starkly polarized&ndash;yes or no, black or white. Yet the shining lights of opportunity and solution are often in the grey, in differing sides being open to new perspectives and ideas and finding middle ground of better understanding. Too often stepping outside the status quo box is punishable, ridiculed, chastised. We are tremendously more than capable of unlearning things we’ve thought to be whole truths, to be vulnerable, to get uncomfortable if it means coming out stronger, wiser, more interconnected. Boxes of linear thinking keep us caged, ignorant, and limited to our true collective potential.</i></p><p><b>Please describe a defining moment in your life that has shaped your values.</b></p><p><i>Growing up I spent a lot of time with my mother, a single parent who immigrated to the U.S. from Honduras. In Honduras she was discovered as a prodigal basketball player, a life she left behind to give me opportunity and a better life. As a child I saw her face many challenges, language, and culture barriers. Yet despite having few means ourselves, my mother would always, without hesitation, go out of her way to help people. From speaking with the cleaning staff at the mall in Spanish, to staying with a man who had a seizure at a bus stop until the ambulance came. She was always reaching out to strangers in kindness without expecting anything back. I once asked her why she felt she had to do this. In her ever-convicted voice she reminded me that people are people, just like us, no matter if it&rsquo;s the President of the United States, or someone without a home. She subconsciously taught me to act with compassion no matter my own circumstances, to respect others no matter their lot in life, and the impacts we can make if we step outside our comfort zones. She inspired the leader I am today.<br/></i></p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130223711524,"NoteCount":45,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZTBl8y1vHy2Ka","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>shoutout to <a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"http://tmblr.co/mIEziGcKiIpIdF3f_3gFsjw\">hashtagnyu</a> on Twitter for this little nugget of great information</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130222878964,"NoteCount":37,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z6XD1v1vHut3q","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":null},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130222089613,"NoteCount":3,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZqZNar1vHrsMD","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130221890061,"NoteCount":9,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZXRbUv1vHr5eD","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Winter is coming and <a href=\"http://hashtagnyu.tumblr.com/post/115850879211/10-ways-nyu-is-actually-game-of-thrones\">no one knows that better than NYU students</a>, of course.

However, Coney Island is an activity that isn’t the same during winter hibernation, so be sure to make this trip soon.</p><br/><h2>Walk the High Line</h2><a href=\"http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hm70l.gif\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://38.media.tumblr.com/734bdc936619ba7901f6f3466a442588/tumblr_inline_nvibndH0Ur1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"249\"/></figure></a><p>It’s way easier to lazily stroll down the High Line when you don’t have to power walk to keep your body temp up. Take advantage of the warmth and check out the beautiful greenery, great views, and perfect backgrounds for your next profile picture.</p><br/><h2>Picnic in a park</h2><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/sofia-coppola-AA1nGh6NaTWX6\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://55.media.tumblr.com/9b2cd83238c61625e6e86ea705ad1b2f/tumblr_inline_nvibno559D1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"300\"/></figure></a><p>Your mind may have automatically assumed Central Park, but <a href=\"http://www.nycgovparks.org/maps\">there are so many more parks to choose from</a>! Head over to Brooklyn and spend the day in Prospect Park or venture to Queens and relax your afternoon away in Flushing Meadows. So many options, so little time!</p><br/><h2>Gaze into the distance on a rooftop</h2><a href=\"http://giphy.com/gifs/new-york-city-cinemagraph-k9y2fq2WTTbR6\"><figure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"429\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"https://33.media.tumblr.com/0519641e120ce32150b783c92038099b/tumblr_inline_nvibnyomLA1ro0zrp_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"429\"/></figure></a><p>While some cities are built outwards, Manhattan was built upwards. This means there are a lot of amazing NYC rooftops with breathtaking views. You and your squad could easily spend a few hours on the MET rooftop looking over Central Park. You could even take a yoga class, catch a film, or mini golf — all on a rooftop! Definitely do this before all roofs are mostly covered in snow&hellip;</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130221413598,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZzGUeo1vHpHJU","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>#NYU #NYC #stroll #colorful #cobblestonestreets #architecture #design #nycdesign #what_I_saw_in_NYC #thebigapple #thevillage #bluesurfstudio #nikon #ig_nyc #igersoftheday #photo #photogram #University #scenesfromthecity #pulledoverforthis #Sundaystroll #streetnook #charming #nyspots #theamericancollective</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130220427134,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z4ZN8v1vHlWT_","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Silent short film for Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking at NYU, 2014.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130220396629,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z4ZN8v1vHlP1L","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":"<p>Short film as final for Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking at NYU, 2014.</p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":130206152457,"NoteCount":5,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZfcBCt1vGv3S9","DateString":"2015-09-30","Text":""},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":33231264464,"NoteCount":0,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/ZlVX6yUylDhG","DateString":"2012-10-09","Text":"<p>feel like my professor just wanted us to look at softcore porn between cupid and psyche all period with these painting.  </p>"},{"Type":"Tumblr","Id":20377690429,"NoteCount":2,"ShortUrl":"http://tmblr.co/Z72nVyI_ck4z","DateString":"2012-04-03","Text":"<p>Everything is pretty much within a 5 minute radius of the Washington Square area. Tisch may haves lectures or classes held in Cantor, I&rsquo;m not sure, but that&rsquo;s only like 4 blocks away from the WS area at most. The only other places I could think of that classes are held are on Mercer Street and 12th St (about a 15 minute walk I&rsquo;d say from Washington Sq), but classes held there are usually things like MAP courses (science, math, Writing the Essay) and I&rsquo;m not sure if as a Tisch student you&rsquo;d have to take those. If you do, they probably hold them closer.</p>\n<p>As far as dorms, closest to &ldquo;campus&rdquo; in order would be Goddard, Weinstein, Hayden, Brittany, Rubin, Founders, and Third North.</p>\n<p>Goddard is <strong>on </strong>Washington Square Park, so you&rsquo;d literally be able to roll out of bed 10 minutes before class and get there on time. However, it&rsquo;s a Residence College so you&rsquo;d have to do a separate application for it. Basically do service projects and events with the residents in the building I believe.</p>\n<p>Weinstein isn&rsquo;t on WSP, but it&rsquo;s so close, it might as well be. About a 5 minute walk to classes, just like Goddard.</p>\n<p>Hayden is a little bit farther but not by much, maybe 5 minutes extra. It&rsquo;s on the opposite side of WSP.</p>\n<p>Brittany is on 9th street so it&rsquo;s about 5/6 blocks away, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s open for Freshman next semester due to renovations.</p>\n<p>Rubin is on 10th St I believe. There&rsquo;s no A/C so I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>\n<p>Founders and Third North are on 12th St, being the farthest dorms. Founders has the big rooms, Third North being apartment-style has the kitchens. About a 15-20 minute walk to class, depending on how fast you walk. </p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re just concerned about distance, I&rsquo;d stick with <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Goddard-Hall/Feeatures-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Goddard</a>/<a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Weinstein/Features-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Weinstein</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nyu.edu/life/living-at-nyu/on-campus-living/explore-the-residencehalls/Hayden-Hall/Features-and-Services.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hayden</a>. They each have something to offer. I linked each of them with their NYU page that gives a list of their features and services, in case you wanna know more about them.</p>"}]
